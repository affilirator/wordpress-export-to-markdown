So by now you have set up your tracking, been accepted to affiliate networks, picked some offers, made a landing page or a few of them, and are ready to start spending money on ad campaigns.  This is where you really tie everything together. Where the rubber hits the road so to speak.

This is a good time to get more familiar with your FunnelFlux setup. You should read through the [FunnelFlux docs](https://help.funnelflux.pro/) and make sure you understand how to input all the basic data into the system such as the affiliate networks, offers, and landing pages you will be using.

FunnelFlux will give you a piece of javascript that needs to go on your landing pages (if you’re using landing pages) and will also be giving you urls that will be used when setting up your ad campaigns.  If you struggle with any of this, [book an appointment](/book-appointment/). I am available for people looking for help.

## Launching Your First Paid Campaign

Alright, so now you want to set up some ad campaigns. But where do you start?

There are literally hundreds of companies that you can make online ad campaigns with.  The most popular and recognizable seem to be the big 2 search engines: Google and Bing.

These above 2 search engines have their own self-serve ad platforms. But you should not by any means feel limited to these.  I, for example, got my start with mobile pop ads, and have never ever had a profitable google search campaign in my life. :-).

Here's a list of mobile pop ad networks that are available for you to try:

1. PopAds
2. PropellerAds
3. DaoAd
4. Vimmy
5. Traffic Nomads
6. Richads
7. Evadav
8. HillTopAds

The list can go on and on. Traffic networks are a dime a dozen.

So which one should you choose? Of all the mobile pop platforms out there that I have  tried, [PopAds](https://mahinge.com/loves/popads/) and [PropellerAds](https://mahinge.com/loves/popads/) have been the easiest to turn a profit. PropellerAds has the most quality pop traffic out there. I have run multiple bot tests on my campaigns, and I can confidently vouch for PropellerAds having the minimal amount of bot traffic.

It would be nearly impossible to include in this tutorial how to create campaigns on all these networks, but fortunately, I don't need to because most of them include pretty comprehensive documentation. So it’s pretty easy to get started… pick a traffic source, read the docs, and get crackin’ making your campaigns.  Not exactly rocket science.

## **Test** Budgets

How much should you spend testing a campaign before declaring it a bust and moving on.  I usually spend 10 times the offer payout testing a campaign to decide if it’s profitable or not. For instance, if an offer pays me $0.35, I'll spend 3.5 dollars testing its viability.

If the cost per click is really high, obviously, this number may have to change as it’s hard to make a solid judgement on like 50 clicks.  If you get a couple thousand clicks on your landing pages and have no conversions, scrap it and move on to something else.
