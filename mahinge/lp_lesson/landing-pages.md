## What is a landing page?

“Landing Page” can have many meanings, but in the Affiliate Marketing world (and for the sake of this tutorial) it generally means a webpage built between the advertisement and the merchant’s page.

Rather than have an advertisement link directly to the merchant page, many people link to an intermediate page which has some kind of sales copy and/or other content, and a link to the merchant page.  Here are some of the reasons people use a “landing page” rather than linking directly to the merchant page:

## **Merchant** Request

For some offers, the merchant requests that affiliates do not link directly to their site.  This may be because they don’t want to have their servers bogged down with a flood of traffic, or maybe they don’t want to be associated with some affilaites’ shady ad copy.

## **Google Ads** Quality **Score**

If you venture into advertising with Google Ads, you will soon learn about [Qualtiy Score](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167118?hl=en), which is a score Google gives to the webpage you are advertising.

This score is made up by a bunch of factors including the content on the page you are trying to advertise.

Many merchant pages have crappy content and will get you a really crappy quality score in return if you link directly to them with a Google Ads Search campaign, so creating an intermediate landing page that will give you a better QS may be beneficial.

There is much more to the QS story, but those are the basics.

## **Improved** Conversion **Rates**

Sometimes you may find that making an intermediate landing page with a good sales pitch will increase the overall conversion rate of your campaign compared to direct linking.

Lets say that you direct link from the ad to the merchant page, and 1% of the people who click your ad end up signing up for whatever offer is on the merchant page.

Then you add an intermediate landing page that really gives some good reasons why people should sign up, and although some people leave the intermediate landing page without ever going to the merchant page, the OVERALL percentage of people that click on your ad that end up signing up for the offer ends up increasing to 3%.

Obviously the landing page is a huge improvement in that case.

## **Multiple** Offers

Intermediate landing pages give you the option of advertising multiple affiliate offers on one page.  Some people make review sites, for example, where they have “reviews” of 5 different similar products.

Other people make pages that encourage the customer to go sign up for several offers.  This has proven to really increase profits if done properly.

Also, you can rotate offers on a landing page such that each click on the landing page leads the user to a different offer.

## **Making Your** Landing **Pages**

Patrick Mahinge is not a design genius.  I’ve made a few landing pages, but I am certainly no expert.  If you want to make a landing page, you can either do it yourself, or pay someone to do it.

There are plenty of starving designers out there who would be more than happy to whip up something for you for a fee.

If you decide to make it yourself, but can’t seem to come up with any good ideas for what your landing page should look like, go google whatever product it is you want to promote, and check out the landing pages others have already made for that product in the Google Ads ads you see.

Another option is to use a spy tool such as Anstrex or AdPlexity. These two are my favorites.

I do not advocate straight up copying the work of others, but you can’t copyright a style, so feel free to make something similar.

Keep in mind, however, that the page you’re emulating may be the work of someone as inexperienced as you are so it may end up a case of the blind leading the blind.  This is why you will need to frequently change your landing pages up in the future to try new things and improve conversions.

Also worth mentioning, some affilaite networks have in-house designers and will whip you up a landing page if you request it.  It’s worth a try =). Other affiliate networks such as [Traffic Company](https://mahinge.com/loves/traffic-company/) also have ready landing pages with their offers.
