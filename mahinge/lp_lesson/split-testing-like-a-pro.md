Once you have some successful, or close to successful ad campaigns running, you will likely want to start refining those campaigns to maximize your profits.

The easiest option for doing this is by testing. Split testing is simply the process of making two variations of part of your campaign, be it your ad, landing page, affiliate offer, whatever, and splitting your traffic between the two to find which works better.

## **Split Testing** Landing **Pages**

Split traffic between two different landing pages to see which one converts better.  [FunnelFlux](https://mahinge.com/loves/funnelflux/) let's you do this visually. SO, you don't have to sweat about it.

Your goals for split testing landing pages will probably be something like reducing bounce rate, increasing clickthrough rate to the offer, and increasing overall conversion rate on the offer.

## **Split Testing** Offers

This one is extremely important. There are so many similar offers out there that it’s impossible to tell which one is going to convert best with your landing page.

IGNORE the EPC data that the networks give you for the offers. They are often meaningless bullshit, and will have no bearing on how well it will convert for you. They could have had some idiot direct linking ppv traffic to the best offer on the network driving the EPC down to like 1/10th of what it will perform for you.

So, as usual, _test for yourself_.  Just like with ad copy split testing, assuming there are several choices for similar products, split test 2 of them, wait till you have enough data to determine which is the better offer, drop the underperformer, and split test the winner with a new offer.

Pretty simple.

If you have enough traffic you could, of course, just split it between all of them at once and find out the winner in a day.
