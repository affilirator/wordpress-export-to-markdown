Well, you don’t have too look far to find a bunch of resources that promise to help you discover your passion. Unfortunately, more often than not, all those resources say the same thing. They say things like: do what makes you happy, do what brings you joy, do what makes you feel good. This advice isn’t wrong. It isn’t bad. It’s just not enough. If you are really going to figure out what you were created to do in your lifetime, you need to find your sweet spot.
