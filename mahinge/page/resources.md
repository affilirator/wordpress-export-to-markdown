I’m a resource nut. I love tools, apps, and services that simplify or amplify what I’m trying to accomplish in blogging for income. So here is my toolbox. These are my recommended tools, products, and services that are either worth an investment, or are incredibly great free resources.

**I’m building this list as I have time. It’s nowhere near complete yet.**

You will be surprised at the tools that I used to create my highest earning blog. They are so simple and easy to get, yet so effective.

## Website Tools

### 1.   Web Hosting: [Uphost.co.ke](https://mahinge.com/recommends/uphost/)

I host all my niche blogs on Uphost, and I fully vouch for the hosting service, because I am one of the co-founders. Our goals for starting the hosting service was to give bloggers inexpensive and scalable hosting that they could identify with.

### 2.  [GoDaddy](https://mahinge.com/recommends/godaddy/ "GoDaddy"): Domain Name Registration

I like to separate my hosting from my domain names. For domain names, I almost always go with [GoDaddy](https://mahinge.com/recommends/godaddy/ "GoDaddy"). They are one of the biggest domain name registrars in the world, and you can't go wrong with them.

### 3.  Premium WordPress Themes- [Themeforest](https://mahinge.com/recommends/themeforest/ "Themeforest")

The look of your blog matters. Users will trust or mistrust your niche blog within 3 seconds of landing on it. To make sure I create a positive and lasting impressions, I use themes from Themeforest on almost all my niche blogs. My personal favorite is the [Rehub WordPress theme](https://mahinge.com/recommends/rehub/ "Rehub WordPress theme"). Take a look at it and you will understand why.

### 4\. Cute Budget Logos- [Fiverr](https://mahinge.com/recommends/fiverr/ "Fiverr")

[Fiverr](https://mahinge.com/recommends/fiverr/ "Fiverr") is my goto place for services ranging from simple logo designs to WordPress customizations. Unlike other freelance marketplaces, freelancers on Fiverr offer quality services at very affordable prices.
