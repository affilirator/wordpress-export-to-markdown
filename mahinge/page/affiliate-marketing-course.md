## **Why Me?  
**Who is Patrick Mahinge?

![Patrick Mahinge Amazon Affiliate Marketing Kenya](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/themes/rehub-theme/images/default/blank.gif)

I am a 30-something-year-old Kenyan guy, a father to one lovely daughter, and a die-hard online marketer. 

I started working online in Kenya more than five years ago and making this choice has been a turning point in my life, no question about it.

I’ve learned a lot, made great friends, and succeeded at this! I achieved some goals I had but still have some in store! :)

To me, succeeding is about **freedom**. It’s getting rid of the so-called “normal” life where working from 9 to 5 to earn peanuts and don’t have time for others sounds ok. I don’t believe in the soundness of this social and economic system. At all.

Stepping out of it is the only way to become who we deeply are. And yes, affiliate marketing is a great way to achieve financial freedom.

I believe in business ethics and an out-of-the-box and fun way of doing internet marketing.

Sharing my vision of affiliate marketing through this website and helping people succeeding is something I enjoy doing.

This business is not rocket science, far, far from it, so I just hope my affiliate marketing guide will inspire you, make you create your own luck and just have the life you want.

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Most frequent questions and answers

#### What is Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing consists of selling products online and earning a commission when doing so. In very simple terms, affiliate marketing involves using the internet to present a product to an audience looking for something. Most of the time, people make a search on a search engine like Google. An affiliate marketer can then create content that will appear in the search results and be found by these people to help them find what they are looking for. If a purchase is made through a link that you own (your affiliate link), you earn a commission. (The free getting started course offered at the bottom of this article will teach you how to get started for free!)

#### Can anyone make money on the Internet?

Yes, yes, YES! Because you have what it takes to succeed online. You don’t have to be a techie person, you don’t need a marketing degree, and you don’t have to very smart (well you may actually be smarter than the big guys in the industry). Think about this…

If you spent as much time working on your affiliate marketing business as you did in your day job, you would be very successful! If you are willing to do what it takes, work consistently and set some clear goals for yourself, you will be surprised as to what you can achieve in this business.

#### I don’t have my own product to sell. Is that OK?

I don’t own any products either. Instead I earn affiliate commissions.

As an “affiliate marketer” you promote other people’s products in exchange for a commissions. When you earn a sale for the merchant, you earn money. These merchants/companies give you “affiliate links” that track your visitors and automatically give you a commission if your visitor buys a product.

Some affiliate networks (like Clickbank) pay 75% on most of the products, so if you sell let say an ebook that is $40, you get a $30 cut. Pretty cool right?

There are tens of thousands affiliate programs out there in every imaginable market. Affiliate marketing definitely isn’t saturated!

Affiliate commissions add up really quickly when you see that you only need to get 4-5 customers out of a billion people online each day to purchase a product through your affiliate link. If an average sale is around $35, you can see that without a lot of work you will be easily making $175 per day every day.

#### Can you guarantee that I will be successful? If not, what can I do to improve my chances?

No, I can’t guarantee that for the simple reason that I can’t know if you will work hard at it and be consistent in your efforts. Still, what I can tell you is that if you work at this business and treat it as such, you will be successful.

The online business world is an open door to everyone. You have the same opportunity as me. If you’re committed and understand the potential of this business and your own potential as an affiliate marketer, sales will come your way and you’ll reach the financial freedom you’re seeking. That’s a certainty.

#### How can I edit smart objects ?  

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation

#### Is the font free ?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur
