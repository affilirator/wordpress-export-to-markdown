## What is Amazon Affiliate Marketing?

Amazon affiliate marketing is a way for you to earn a commission by promoting products from Amazon.com on your own website or social media platform. Here's how it works:

1. First, you'll need to sign up for the Amazon Associates program. This is a free program that allows you to earn commissions by promoting products from Amazon on your website or social media.

3. Once you're signed up, you'll receive a unique affiliate link for each product you want to promote. This link contains a special tracking code that tells Amazon that you're the one who referred the customer to their site.

5. You can then share this link on your website or social media platforms, or you can create ads or blog posts that include the link.

7. When a customer clicks on your link and makes a purchase on Amazon, you'll earn a commission. The commission rate varies based on the product category, but it's usually between 4% and 8%.

Imagine that you have a blog or website about cooking. You might include a section on your site where you recommend different kitchen appliances, utensils, and ingredients. You can use your Amazon affiliate links to promote these products and earn a commission when a customer clicks on your link and makes a purchase.

It's important to note that Amazon affiliate marketing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes time and effort to build up your website or social media following, and you'll need to be patient and consistent in your marketing efforts. But with hard work and dedication, it can be a great way to monetize your online presence and earn some extra income.

# What is Affiliate Marketing?  

An affiliate is a person or company who is associated with another person or company. Affiliates generally use their own resources to promote or advertise for someone else in return for some kind of compensation.

**The short version**: Affiliate marketing defines the industry in which affiliated "_salespeople_" drive customers to products and services in exchange for a commission.

**The long(er) version**: The term affiliate marketing encompasses a wide variety of online money making business activities. As an affiliate, you are an online sales person for another company. The merchant will allow you to promote their products online. It is up to you to decide:

1) Where to advertise  
2) How to advertise  
3) Who will see your advertisements

## What Are the Advantages of Affiliate Marketing?

The great thing about affiliate marketing is that you don’t deal with any inventory, shipping, or customer service issues. You simply drive traffic to a product and hope for a conversion.

In exchange for your efforts, the merchant will provide you with a commission every time you successfully drive a customer to the merchants website and it results in a sale. Often times, all you need the customer to do is enter some information such as an e-mail address or a phone number. Other times, you will need to get the customer to whip out their credit card and make a purchase. The amount of commission that you make per conversion depends entirely on how difficult it is to make that conversion and how much the product costs (if anything).

## How Amazon Affiliate Marketing Work?

Amazon Affiliate Marketing Explained

![amazon affiliate marketing Kenya](images/image-from-rawpixel-id-456067-deriv-1.png)

Let’s say you are an affiliate for Amazon.com (Our preferred merchant). Obviously, Amazon wants to make as many sales as possible. To accomplish this, they will give you a piece of their profit in the form of a commission if you are able to get someone to buy one of their products on Amazon.com via one of your advertisements.

The way they track your sales is through an “**_affiliate link_**.” You will place your affiliate link in your advertisements. You will be credited with a sale each time someone visits Amazon.com through your affiliate link and makes a purchase. It’s that easy!

Imagine if you could repeat this process over and over again. How many sales do you think you could make if you were able to place your advertisement with your affiliate link in front of millions of people per day? **A lot.**

_Welcome to the world of affiliate marketing._

### Where can I Learn Affiliate Marketing in Kenya?

Chances are that you are looking to _learn affiliate marketing_ if you are reading this. It’s great that you know the **affiliate definition** and what to know more. In fact, there are TONS of online resources that will help you in your education. Google, as always, should be your friend. You will find some good content if you spend some time searching.

However, most people (myself included), enjoy having a breadth of information condensed into a single source. The reason for this varies from person to person, but it generally has to do with being able to track their progress and seeing how far they are away from becoming knowledgeable about a particular subject.

In the affiliate marketing world, there are MANY different flavors that encompass the whole. The truth is that you will never become an expert at everything within affiliate marketing because things evolve at too rapid of a pace. Most people start by getting an idea of the different areas involved and then choosing one to master. Some of the major ways to drive traffic to an offer include:

- (PPC) Pay Per Click Advertising

- (SEO) Search Engine Optimization

- Media Buys

- PPV

Each one of those methods takes time to learn. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. In addition to the methods to drive traffic, you will have to have some knowledge of the following:

- Web Design

- Affiliate Networks

- Campaign Tracking

- Writing Great Sales Copy and Content

As you can see, there is a lot to learn. If you’re one of those people that enjoy to have everything available to you in one place while having a great support system, then you may want to enroll for my one-on-one affiliate training sessions or book a one off consultation to learn more.
