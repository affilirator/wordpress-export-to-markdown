## How to Start a Blog in Kenya

- Getting a domain name and hosting
- Getting traffic to your blog

### Choosing a Niche for Your Blog

![blogging niches in kenya](images/blogging-niches-in-kenya.jpg)

If you want to make money blogging in Kenya, you need to carefully choose the topic for your blog. Treat it like a business and it will earn you money for years to come. So, how do you do this?

**Every blog should have a niche**. A niche is a topic which you can confidently write about with a lot of authority. Some of the most common blog niches in Kenya include fashion, sports, cooking, travel, and business.

There's a catch, however. Try to be as unique as possible in your blog. Don't do what everyone else is doing.

For instance, if you've chosen fashion as your niche, instead of blogging generic fashion information, how about going for **environmental conscious fashion** as a niche? That instantly sets you apart from a multitude of other fashion bloggers in Kenya.

The niche for this blog leans towards **making money online in Kenya**. You'll rarely find other topics not related to making money on this blog. That's my niche. It is what I know best. And what I can write about with a lot of authority.

> Don't blog about just anything that comes to mind. Many Kenyans make the mistake of turning their blogs into personal scrapbooks.

Such a blog where you post your personal life escapades is more of a scrapbook than a business blog. Like, take an example if you wanted to make money from blogging by having companies place ads on your blog. Do you think a company is interested in your life? Nope. Unless you're one of the best known influencers in Kenya.

### Get a Domain Name and Web Hosting for Your Blog

This is the little technical part about starting a blog in Kenya. But don't panic. Starting a blog is not rocket science and anyone with some basic information can do it.

The two things you need to get your blog rolling is a domain and web hosting. There are two approaches to these. You can choose to go with free blogging options or choose to create your own custom website.

We'll take you through the two options, including the pros and cons for each so that you can make the right decision for your business blog.

#### 1\. Free Blogging Platforms in Kenya

Free blogging options are good if you want to blog as a hobby. They make it very easy to start blogging.

However, as you'll soon learn, the allure of the free blogging platforms is short-lived**. There are more limitations than advantages with free blogging sites**. For starters, no one will take you seriously when you're blogging on a free blogging platform.

Additionally, many of the free blogging sites do not allow you to place banners or affiliate links on the site. This greatly limits your available income streams.

##### Best Free Blogging Platforms in Kenya

Some of the most popular free blogging platforms in Kenya include

1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
2. [Blogger](https://blogger.com/)
3. [Medium](https://medium.com/)
4. [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com/)

##### Pros

Easy to Setup and completely free

##### Cons

Very limited on the customization

Not enough storage space for a lot of images, videos and other personal files

You cannot place affiliate links, ad banners, and basically very limited on monetization

The free blogging platform retains the right to delete your blog.

##### 2\. Creating Your Own Website

If you're dedicated to blogging and want to make money blogging, this is the best option for you. The only downside is that it will cost you money to start your own website.

**_The upside?_**

You'll have a lot of customization and monetization options to try.

Although creating your own website is a little techy, it is nothing you can't do in under one hour and with a good tutorial online. If you still don't think you can hack it, The People Founder, [Patrick Mahinge](https://mahinge.com/) has a [website setup service that you can try](https://mahinge.com/free-wp/).

To begin creating your website, you'll need a domain name and web hosting account. We recommend [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/africaninstitute/) as they have a good offer and make the whole process so easy.

##### Create Your Website

If your goal is to make money blogging, you'll need a custom website as opposed to free blogging sites. Get started for as low as $3.00 per month + a free domain name.

#### How much do bloggers earn in Kenya?

Individual bloggers in Kenya earn at least $1000 per month. This money comes from various monetization methods such as AdSense, ad sales, affiliate marketing, and guest posts.

#### How do I register my blog in Kenya?

To register your blog in Kenya, you'll need a domain name and web hosting. A domain name is a unique address for your blog. An example is **[mahinge.com](/)**, which is the domain name for this blog. On the other hand, web hosting is where the files for your blog live. All the images and content you add to your blog live in the web hosting account. We recommend that you choose a reliable company such as BlueHost for domain name and hosting registration.
