Heavy traffic on a major highway is downright disruptive and disgusting; try to imagine driving along Langa’ta road on a Monday morning! In fact heavy traffic is disgusting almost anywhere except when maybe it is directed to your business, like lets  say your blog. It then becomes not only desirable but outright desirable.

[The best affiliate programs](https://mahinge.com/the-naked-truth-about-affiliate-marketing-programs/ "affiliate programs") rely on your blog traffic stats to determine whether they are going to approve your request to join their network.

Major traffic on your blog also gives you the morale you need to keep [blogging and making money](https://mahinge.com/fully-monetize-blog-kenya/ "make money blogging in kenya"), and is pivotal to your chances of becoming a successful blogger.

Getting traffic buzzing into your website is quite easy and is not really a major concern to many bloggers. But keeping the traffic glued to your page for more than a few nanoseconds or making them return to your site is entirely a horse of another color. There is however a few things you can do to drive and maintain traffic to your site.

#### **1\. Content, content and content** 

Don’t bullshit yourself about this one.

The quality and quantity of your blog content is the key reason any web surfer would like to return to your page or to your blog. It Is the only reason they will type your blog name or web address in the address bar of their browser, right?

Quality content makes you rank well with the search engines, places you at the top of the search engine result pages (SERPs). It will make other bloggers want to link back to you. Of course all these translate to added traffic to your blog, and hopefully you won’t need to spam the social sites with your links in the hope of getting some visitors to your blog.

2. **Have a well-designed blog template** 

Let’s assume you have super content, but the way it is arranged on the blog isn’t the little bit eye-catching. Let’s assume the navigation bars and general design of your site is so complicated for the general web user to understand, you see where we are headed with this?

The design of your website or blog matters.

#### 3\. User interactivity 

How well are the different elements on your blog responsive to user interaction? This is really a no-brainer. I have seen users spend hours of their time on a blog that had some bits of flare, like hover effects on text links and images. This is easily done via CSS3 or simple JavaScript widgets.

#### 4\. Blog consistently 

That may sound obvious, but every blogger will tell you it is not that accomplishable. Readers would constantly check on your blog once they realize that you are most likely to have some new content in your website. Writing often also increases your chances of ranking well with search engine.

#### 5\. Utilize Backlinks

Backlinks are powerful when it comes to SEO. They also have the immeasurable ability to increase traffic to your blog. One of the key ways of getting quality backlinks to your content is asking other bloggers to link back to you in exchange of you linking back to them. Writing quality content also enhances the chances of getting external links incoming to your blog.

#### 6\. Leave quality comments in other blogs 

While most bloggers have the ‘nofollow’ attribute turned on their blog comments, leaving some quality and informative comments (as opposed to spamming or commenting just for the sake) on their blogs will enhance the chance that a visitor in the blog you are commenting on will most likely follow the link back to your site, thus building some traffic. Make sure you leave your name and URL on the blog you are commenting in.

#### 7\. Website Speed

If your site is not optimized for faster pageload, there is a very high probability that you are losing some traffic. Web surfer do not have the patience or the bandwidth to suffer slow loading webpages. You can check for the speed of your website using the [Pingdom Website Speed Tool](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fpt "website speed").
