## Frequently Asked Questions About Successful Forex Trading in Kenya

### How much do forex traders make in Kenya?

Business Daily reported that the average forex trader in Kenya makes around $500-$750 per month. However, it's important to note that this is just an average and some traders make significantly more or less than this amount.  
  
Factors that can impact how much forex traders make in Kenya include their trading strategy, the amount of capital they're working with and the size of their trades. Other considerations include the volatility of the markets and the trader' s experience level.  
  
A beginner forex trader in Kenya might only make a few thousand dollars per year, while a more experienced trader could make several hundred thousand dollars per year. The sky is the limit for how much money you can make as a forex trader in Kenya.

### Is Forex trading profitable in Kenya?

Yes, forex trading can be quite profitable in Kenya if you have the right skills and knowledge. There are many traders who make a full-time income from trading forex, and some who even become quite wealthy.  
  
However, it takes more than just Skills and Economics 101 to beat the markets. You need to have strong self-discipline and emotional control, as well as a sound risk management strategy. And of course, it goes without saying that you need to have a decent amount of capital to start with.  
  
But if you have what it takes, forex trading can be very profitable indeed. Just remember that like any form of investing, there is always risk involved – so don't risk more than you can afford to lose.  
  
Some of the most successful forex traders in Kenya include Patrick Mahinge, Ken Githaiga, and Paul Mugenda. All of these traders have made a lot of money from trading forex, and they all have different strategies that they use to achieve success.  
  
Mahinge is a scalper, which means he takes a large number of small trades throughout the day in order to try and make a profit on each one. Githaiga is a trend follower, which means he looks for longer-term changes in the market and tries to ride them out for as long as possible. Mugenda is a contrarian, which means he goes against the crowd and tries to profit from when the market is moving in the opposite direction to what most people expect.  
  
All three traders have had success with their different approaches, but it's important to remember that there is no guaranteed way to make money through forex trading. Anyone who claims otherwise is likely trying to scam you.  
  
The best way to become a successful forex trader is to learn as much as possible, start with a small amount of capital and be prepared to lose some money along the way. With enough time and effort, anyone can become a successful forex trader.
