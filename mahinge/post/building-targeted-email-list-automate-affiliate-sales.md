One of the biggest opportunities for consistent and automated sales that many internet marketers overlook completely is creating an “evergreen” asset with their autoresponder.

The idea is simple:

Preload an entire year’s worth of mailings (content + offers) into an autoresponder list and then work towards building your subscriber base.

## What happens?

1. \* You promote the list and subscribers begin to join.
2. Week after week they receive installments with useful content and promotional offers.
3. Subscribers become customers as they order offers they find relevant.
4. You send out “special” broadcast mailings for time-sensitive offers to boost income.
5. Multiple streams of income are produced from a variety of offers that you funnel into the mailings.
6. You focus promotion effort into building this one list as it is the hub of your offers.

#### Think about this:

What could be easier than doing nothing but promote this evergreen asset?

What if that was ALL you had to do in order to make money?

Seriously.  You could do NOTHING else but setup this list and focus your entire efforts onto getting people to join the list.

The mailings will take care of the rest.

- No more products to create!
- No more blogs to maintain!
- No more webpages to manage!
- No more new things to try!

Setup a weekly mailing and you’ve got 52 opportunities to sell something to your list of subscribers. That's what I am doing with my [penis pump reviews](https://lubeanalyst.com/best-penis-pump/) site.

And once those 52 mailings are gone, add 52 more to the exact same autoresponder sequence (now making it 102 weeks of promotion!).

Whether you format it as a weekly newsletter, tip of the week, lesson, training program, email membership site, etc, the result is the same:  you’ve got automated promotions for an entire year going out.

And you’ve gone from a complicated series of “internet marketing” things-to-do to a simple one task focus.

All you’ve got to do is work on list-building.  The money-making is automated.

Let’s say you average $100 per year in profit from each subscriber you get into the funnel.  That’s a very realistic number considering that you can make over that amount from just ONE OFFER.  Remember you’ll have 52 offers in the series.  Plus “special” broadcasts that aren’t preloaded that you send out to the list.  I have customers who repeatedly spend $500 for ONE order from me.

So, let’s say over a year’s time, every subscriber in your series of mailings is worth $100 to you.  That’s certainly more than reachable.

Do you realize that it would only take 1,000 subscribers for you to earn a six-figure income?

Do you further realize many lists have tens of thousands of subscribers, some even stretching to hundreds of thousands?

Imagine if you could get just 5,000 subscribers onto your list with your $100 per year profit from each on average.  That’s $500,000 per year in profit!

All from doing ONE THING:  Setting up the evergreen asset and then spending your time generating leads.

That’s a business model that is super simple!

All you need is…

1\. **A landing page**. (I use ThriveArchitect to churn out beautiful landing pages in minutes) 2. **An autoresponder** with 52 installments of your content/promotion blend. (I recommend Aweber) 3. **Subscribers**

You could do NOTHING ELSE but this and make a nice living online.
