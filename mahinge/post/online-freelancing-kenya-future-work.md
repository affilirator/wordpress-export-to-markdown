You’re missing out.

Seriously.

Its happening all over the world.   Massive changes are taking place in the work force.  Some call it the worker revolution. I simply call it freelancing. Online freelancing. [That’s what I do](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/transcription "transcription").  Maybe that’s what you ought to do too.

You see, once upon a time, you would go to school, study and complete your college/ university education. Get a good white collar job; work in that same company or organization till the day you died or till you retired.

I’m sorry, that sounds plain and boring but that’s the way it used to be.

Used to be.

Until the harsh economic times slapped us in our faces, the population skyrocketed like crazy and now we have thousands upon thousands of people looking for jobs and setting up small businesses at least to get their daily bread.

But there is another option and it’s called freelancing. Freelancing simply means that you are self-employed and you sell your services to clients.

Services such as writing, graphic design, video editing, transcription et cetera. After you have completed your project, you are paid and everyone’s happy.

And that’s why companies are jumping on to this online worker revolution ‘thing’.  Companies are now able to access thousands of people who have got some serious skills in different areas.  People who are self-motivated and are serious about growing their online businesses.  In fact in the recent years, online freelancing has experienced exponential growth.  Take a look at these stats:

•    [Fiverr.com](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/www.fiverr.com "Fiverr"), founded in 2009 has since 2011 seen a growth rate of  600%.  It has been positioned among the top 200 most popular sites in the whole world.   Fiverr is an online marketplace that offers services called 'gigs'  that start at $5.

•    [Elance](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/?rid=2R0Q0 "Elance"), another freelancing site, announced on March 9th that freelancers had earned over $1 billion with that platform. Elance has also entered the Egyptian online freelancing market and hopes to tap into the amazing potential in the region.

•    [Freelancer.com](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mahinge1 "freelancer.com"), an Australian freelancing marketplace also announced that it had acquired Polish freelancing company, Zlecenia. The company – Freelancer.com – has been doing so well that it filed for an IPO in Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange.

I really do not want to bore you with the statistics. I could go on and on. The fact is that the ‘digital online lifestyle’ as Odesk calls it, is here to stay and that is great news for those looking for online freelancing work in Kenya.

Matt Cooper, the Vice President of Enterprise and International at oDesk is quoted as saying

\[blockquote author="Matt Cooper"\] "… there are a couple of trends underway that are determining what the future of work looks like. One trend is the move towards a freelance economy. The fluidity that we're moving in and out of jobs is increasing. We're headed to a world where you're working for five companies at one time, instead of one company for five years ... "\[/blockquote\]

I don’t know about you but I’m pretty excited about the future of online freelancing.  I started out freelancing by offering video transcription services and now I have a blog.  In fact, [feel free to visit it here](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/www.workonlinekenya.com "work online Kenya"). I’d love to hear from you.

And if you are like me and you are  an action taker, then sign up with Elance or oDesk today and join  millions more in the Worker Revolution. I can only see good times  coming our way.
