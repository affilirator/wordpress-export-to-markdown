When you are given a task to do, it is yours and no one else’s. No one but you will get it done. Blaming others will not help at the end of the day, you are the one who will be held responsible, not them.

### 5\. Find someone to hold you accountable

If you are not answerable to anyone, find someone who will hold you accountable. Someone who will ask you questions if you do not achieve your goals in the set deadline.

### 6\. Eliminate the bad habits and develop good ones

Examine your daily habits.

Which ones are standing in the way of your progress?

When and why do you keep doing this?

Once you have identified this, you can easily work towards eliminating those habits that are harmful and develop ones that are beneficial. Those that will not stand in the way of your progress, but rather help you achieve your goals.

### 7\. Start on the task
