## What's Pepperstone Markets Kenya?

Pepperstone is an online forex trading broker that has been in business since 2010. The company is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

Pepperstone was founded in 2010 by a group of traders who were frustrated with the quality of trading tools and services available at the time. They believed that retail traders deserved access to the same level of technology and tools that had been traditionally reserved for hedge funds and institutional investors.

So they set out to create a better brokerage, one that would put the trader first and offer innovative technology, competitive spreads, and world-class customer service. The company has since grown into one of the largest forex brokers in the world, with over 200,000 clients in more than multiple countries.

From those early days, Pepperstone has always been committed to providing the best possible trading experience for its clients. This means delivering quality products and services, offering competitive spreads and prices, and providing 24/5 support. The company has grown rapidly over the years, but this commitment to excellence remains at the core of everything Pepperstone does.

In 2021, Pepperstone obtained a trading license from the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya. Pepperstone Markets Kenya LTD was thus born.

There are many advantages of trading with Pepperstone in Kenya, but some of the key benefits include:

- Award-winning customer service - 24/7 live support, plus fast and efficient email support.
- The widest range of tradable currency pairs and CFDs - over 120 different instruments to choose from.
- Low spreads and commissions - tight spreads from just 0.6 pips on EUR/USD, and low commissions starting at just $3.5 per trade.
- Advanced trading platforms - including the powerful cTrader, MetaTrader 4 platform, as well as the new MetaTrader 5 platform.

The Spreads are an important consideration when choosing a forex broker. A lower spread means that you can trade with a tighter spread and get better prices on your trades.

Pepperstone offers some of the most competitive spreads and commissions in the industry. For example, their spread on the EUR/USD is as low as 0.6 pips per lot. They are a true ECN broker, which means that your orders are routed directly to the market without any interference from Pepperstone. This allows them to offer spreads as low as 0.0 pips on major currency pairs. This makes Pepperstone a great choice for traders who want to get the most out of their trading experience.

Here is a list of some of the more common fees and commissions you may encounter when trading with Pepperstone:

1. **Spreads**: Pepperstone offers some of the tightest spreads in the industry. For example, their EUR/USD spreads are as low as 0.1 pips. This is considerably tighter than what most of the competition can offer. This means that you'll save money on every trade you make, and your profits will be amplified as a result. Overall, Pepperstone is an excellent choice for any trader who is looking for low-cost trading options.
2. **Swap or rollover fees**: These are incurred when you hold a position overnight. They are calculated as the interest differential between currencies multiplied by the notional value of your trade. For example, if you have a long EUR/USD position and the interest rate for EUR is higher than USD, you will be charged a swap fee.
3. **Commission**: This is a flat fee that is charged for each trade you make. It is calculated as a percentage of the total transaction value. Pepperstone only charges commissions on their Razor Accounts.
