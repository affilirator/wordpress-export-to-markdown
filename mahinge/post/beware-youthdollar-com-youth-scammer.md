I have written about these [online scams](https://mahinge.com/scam-alert "scam alert") till my fingers have gotten blistered but I won't stop spreading the message. I won't simply watch as you enter into the devil's lair, get scammed and start shouting to anyone who cares to listen how you cannot make money online.

> FYI: I make all my money online. I do not have a daytime job and I do not do these get-rich quick scams. You can [join my mentorship program](https://mahinge.com/start-free-blog/ "Blogscheme Mentorship Programme") to learn of the genuine ways that I use to make money online.

 

Back to Youth Dollar and related scams:

All these opportunities that promise to pay you $5-$10 for sharing a link on your Facebook, Twitter and other social network channels are nothing but scams.

The ones that I have already written about are [Earn4Youth.com](https://mahinge.com/earn4youth-scam/ "Earn4Youth scam") and [PayFunda.Biz](https://mahinge.com/payfunda-biz-scam-cant-withdraw-money/ "Payfunda.biz scam"). The last one to join my list of shame is **YouthDollar.Com**.

## What is YouthDollar.com?

If you _choose to trust_ the information  on their website, **YouthDollar** is a revolutionary [work-at-home opportunity](https://mahinge.com/make-money-online/ "work at home") that will pay you thousands of dollars simply for copying and pasting a dubious affiliate link on your Facebook and Instagram wall.

## How Do I know that Youth Dollar is a Scam?

1. For the past few weeks that I have been monitoring the Youth Dollar scam David Bekham, CaralBoxer and some few other individuals have been paid the same constant amount everyday. This is despite the website claiming that payments are made between the 24th and 30th of every month. How comes David Bekham is being paid everyday?
2. I am made to understand that **I will be paid via Western Union, cheque or money order**. Great! But where will Youth Dollar send these paper payments? I was not asked for my post office or other relevant details that would enable 'the company' to process my payments. And there is no place to edit my account to include these details. Right. Lets assume that you will still be paid but only in your imaginary online account. Congratulations on becoming the next internet millionaire and good luck with withdrawing your earnings from YouthDollar.com!
3. **How can I contact YouthDollar.com** in case I have problems with my account? **_Surprise!_** You will never get your hands on the contacts details of Youth Dollar, simply because 'the company' does not exist. Hint: Every genuine company provides its web visitors with a contact us page.
4. The **bad grammar** on the website is a complete turn off. Have you noticed how [Earn4Youth](https://mahinge.com/earn4youth-scam/), Monthly Youth, [PayFunda](https://mahinge.com/payfunda-biz-scam-cant-withdraw-money/) and YouthDollar can never seem to get the placement of the dollar symbol right? Have you also noticed how poor the grammar on these websites is? This is a common [characteristic of all online scams](https://mahinge.com/legitimate-work-home-jobs/). The next time someone tries to lure you into one of these scams, tell them to invest in a good English Dictionary with the money they would have used to pay you.
5. No advertiser is going to pay $5 or $10 for just visiting their website. Seriously, even [Google Adsense](https://mahinge.com/start-successful-blog-brings-money-fame/), which charges more expensively for advertisements does not pay out this much to bloggers. I will repeat it for the umpteenth time. There is no easy way yo make money online. If you are looking for one, try gambling.
6. What do I do if I had already joined Youth Dollar? You need to thoroughly scan your computer for malwares that the website might have planted on your computer. To scan and clean your computer, [download this anti-malware software.](http://www.mb38.com/lnk.asp?o=6984&c=918271&a=164099)

## What is the Aim of the YouthDollar.com Scam?

I hope we have established beyond any reasonable doubt that YouthDollar.com is a scam. I will now explain to you how these online scams play on you.

First of All, scams in the league of YouthDollar are often after your email address. They use the email address to send you other offers of how you have can make money online just by doing some simple tasks. They lure you into more and more scams with a goal of three major things.

- Increase traffic to their websites and earn more from the advertisements displayed
- Lure you into buying 'products' that promise you to make an internet millionaire.
- Harvest thousands of emails and sell them to third-party scammers.
