Let us not beat around the bush here. The only reason you are not [making enough money online](https://mahinge.com/ "making money online") is because you are not an action taker and you give up too easily. You are letting a lot of money slip through your hands by postponing taking action.

I want to show you exactly how you can start earning a lot of money online by simply **taking action**.

At the end of the post, I will give you some of the links and ways you can use to earn online money in Kenya. I would love to see if you really have the **get rich or die trying mentality of earning an online income in Kenya,** and this will be your test.

The first thing I will demand you do is [start a professional blog](https://mahinge.com/tips-make-money-blog-kenya/ "mAKe money blogging"). You can do so by registering for a hosting account in [ipage](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage "ipage web hosting") or [Bluehost](https://mahinge.com/visit/Bluehost "Bluehost"). You can think of your blog as a kiosk or store. It is where your customers will find you when they need you.

The next thing that you will need to do is join a freelance jobs website such as [Freelancer.com](https://mahinge.com/visit/freelancer "Freelancer") or [Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/elance) and start bidding for freelance jobs. With these sites and your blog, you have everything that you need to start earning money online. I will be sharing more of the small steps that make a big difference at the end of this post. You can also join my mailing list to receive all the other online earning opportunities that surface from time to time.

## **Moving on…**

You probably have an idea that you can make money online in Kenya. The evidence is there in my monthly online income earnings. I also make a point of giving detailed instructions on [how you can make money online in Kenya](https://mahinge.com/).

If you do not have this information at hand, it is because [you are not in my mailing list](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/50720094.htm), which further speaks of you not being an action taker.

Taking action marks the difference between people who succeed in life and ones who will never make any significant improvements in their lives. The opposite of taking action is postponing/procrastination, and this my friend is the father of all failures in life.

But, how can you make the switch from a person who only consumes information passively to one who gathers information and takes action on it?

## **My Story- How I started Making Money Online**

I am very successful freelance writer in [Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/elance), [Odesk](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/www.odesk.com) and [iWriter](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/www.iwriter.com). I also double-up as an internet marketer. I have a salary of 40-80k per month from freelance job websites and a few dollars from doing internet marketing. However, this was not always the case. In fact, I remember joining [Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/elance) on July of 2012. I applied for a few jobs, never got them and that almost marked the end of my online earning dreams.

One year later, Timothy Chege, a nice chap that we had attended college together, suggested that I could make money from freelance writing. At that time, I was running a very disjointed blog that centered around my life chasing women, being estranged from my father and failing to appear on the graduation list.

I took Timothy’s word seriously.

I joined Odesk, [Freelancer.com](https://mahinge.com/visit/freelancer) and reactivated my account in [Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/elance). I shudder to think what would have happened if I had not taken action. I would be tied among the sad group of employees who survive on a measly paycheck from one end of the month to the other.

_**Listen, the secret to every form of success lies in taking action now.**_

This is what I refer to as the Get-Rich-or-Die-Trying-Mentality of earning online money in Kenya. I can never stress enough on how important it is to transform yourself into an action taker

Another real life example of how taking action can take you to where you want to be is this blog that I run.

I was very green on the blogging world when I started it. I just had the slight notion that I could [earn online money](https://mahinge.com/) through blogging but I never knew about such important aspects such as content marketing and SEO.

Because I took action, I have grown this blog into one of the most trustworthy and visited blogs in Kenya. I have been able to achieve a Google Page Rank of 4 in just two years of serious blogging and I am making a lot of money online everyday all because I took action.

If you really believe in taking action, use the following steps to start dabbling with online income in Kenya now. Remember, there is no time like the present.

## **Step #1 Start Blogging**

- **Start a Blogger or Wordpress blog**\- It is absolutely free to start a blog on these two platforms. Although not very professional, starting a blog on one of these platforms gives you a head start on blogging and allows you to monetize your blog through ad networks such as [infolinks](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/publishers.infolinks.com) or [Chitika](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/publishers).However,if you really want to be accepted by many affiliate programs, you will need to [register for a premium domain](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage).

 

- **Join an Affiliate Network**\- In order to monetize your blog, you will need to join one or a few affiliate networks. You can think of affiliate networks as a meeting place for bloggers and business owners who want you to advertise their products on your blog. You will get paid for every link/ad on your blog that is clicked, viewed or for every sale that is completed from your blog. Back when I was starting, I joined Commission Junction and Share-a-Sale. You can also start with these two although there are multiple other affiliate networks that you can use to make money online.

 

- **Write SEO Optimized Content**\- SEO stands for [Search Engine Optimization](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/what-is-seo). In this case, writing search engine optimized content means that you write content that contains [keywords](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/what-are-keywords.htm) that people are using when searching for information on the internet. For instance, a lot of Kenyans are seeking information on how they can make money on the internet.  Words like ‘earn online income, work from home jobs and genuine data entry, freelance jobs in Kenya e.t.c are often used to search for this information.

Before you read the next section,if you believe in taking action,  take it now. Share this information on your favorite social media profile, and I will send you a free report on how you can make $35 per day online. \[sociallocker id="3397"\]Thanks for sharing! I love you soooo....\[/sociallocker\]

## **Step #2 Join a Freelance Jobs Website**

1. There are several **online job websites** that are absolutely free to join and that are reputable enough. The three that I usually recommend Kenyans who are in my mailing list include

- Elance
- Odesk, and
- Freelancer
- [iWriter](https://mahinge.com/7-incredible-tips-maintaining-awesome-ratings-iwriter/ "iwriter")

Before you join any of these freelance job websites, make sure that you have identified what services you want to sell there. You can probably do freelance writing, web design, graphics and logo design, virtual assistance, data entry jobs or accounting jobs among many other freelance jobs.

Only pick one field to specialize in as having a profile cluttered with too much specialties speaks of being a jack of all trades but a master of none. For instance, although I can build websites and design professional logos, I only include my writing skills on my profile in freelance job websites.

## **Step #3 Taking Your Online Income to the Next Level**

If you hang long enough doing step one and two, you will realize that online income and opportunities are very lucrative. You will naturally get the urge to take it to the next level. You will want to get a [self-hosted blog](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/63392) instead of relying on blogger and wordpress.

You will want to start hiring freelancers instead of doing all the donkeywork. I am currently at this stage. I have several blogs hosted on [ipage and bluehost](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/africaninstitute). I also hire freelance writers through [my elance client profile](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/?rid=2R0Q01).

Apart from hiring freelancers, I moved [my elance freelancer profile](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/?rid=2R0Q02) from free basic membership to Individual Membership where I am paying $10 per month. In the next few months (starting from June), I will be moving the membership from Individual to Small Company, and I will be paying $20 per month for the membership.

Additionally, [I signed up for aweber email autoresponders](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blogscheme.aweber.com) to help me carry out more vigorous email marketing campaigns. I pay $19 per month for the aweber email  autoresponder and make  more than that through the email autoresponder.

The combination of things in step 3 is what I would call the Get Rich or Die Trying Mentality of Making Money Online in Kenya. You cannot expect to have everything on a silver platter. You will at times need to make some sacrifices in order to succeed.

I mentioned about the other small things you can do to make money online in Kenya. I will not include them here. Instead, I want you to show your commitment to **becoming an action-taker** [by joining my mailing list now](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/50720094.htm). I will then send you a comprehensive list of the small things you can do to make an extra income online including being paid to tweet and to participate in social media sharing.
