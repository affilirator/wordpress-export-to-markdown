If you are reading this post, you are one of the few persons that will witness my crazy blogging journey.

I have set a crazy challenge for myself.

Starting April 2016, I will be attempting to build a new blog from scratch and looking forward to selling it for more than 10 Million Kenya shillings in one and half years.

As of right now, I have bought a brandable domain name, and I have a vague idea of how I intend to grow the blog.

## Content Creation

For the first few weeks, I have set $160 for content creation. With this amount, I intend to get about 20 articles, each one of them about 2000 words.

I expect the first phase of content creation to take about 2 weeks. Most of the content in the first phase will be product reviews for products on Amazon in my niche.

The fact that I am setting a budget for this project goes to show how serious I am about it. I could have chosen to write the articles by myself, but that would be self-defeating.

I know myself.

I am lazy AF.

And paying a writer $8.00 to write a 2000 words blog post is a jackpot. But isn’t that so damn cheap? No. It is not. But I am not getting into that debate right now.

Later on, I expect to create more content about the industry to drive traffic.

Content Promotion

I am expecting some major love from Google on this project. I expect a third of my traffic to come from Google… but I am not stopping there.

Only a fool believe that if he builds it they will come.

So, what’s my strategy?

Social media promotion will play a key role in driving traffic. I will also be doing a few guest posts on related websites. Reddit also have a very dedicated to this niche.

I will also be hunting the internet for niche forums.
