If you did your KCSE in 2013, you might be happy to note that KNEC finally released the KCSE results today after some delays. The release of **the 2013 KCSE results** however also marks a time in your life when you should sit back and reflect on what you really want to do with your life.

Whatever grade you got in the exams, you just cannot afford to relax. Life does not offer you that laxity.

At [Kenyan Pridespot](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kenyanpridespot1.com), we have suggestions that might prove workable for you. There are many jobs you can do from home and make money online. To get started however, you will need three things:

1. Basic skills in using a computer including typing and how to use MS Office applications
2. A computer
3.  internet connection

If you have all these three, you are good to go! [Join my mailing list here](https://mahinge.com "Make Money Online"). I will show you workable tips on how you can make money online.

Students who sat for their 2013 KCSE in secondary schools that offer computer lessons are at an added advantage here since they might already have the basic computer skills.

This does not however mean that you cannot learn how to use a computer if the school where you sat for your KCSE exams did not have computer classes.

Borrowing from my story, I sat for the KCSE exams in 2005 in a district day school that did not even have the luxury of electricity leave alone computers but one week after doing my KCSE, I had all the computer skills I needed to start making money.

I did this by visiting a friend who had a music shop with a computer and started fumbling with the computer until I became ardent at it.

If you are interested in making money online, I recommend that you read this article about [Make Money Online](https://mahinge.com/make-money-online-kenya/ "The Get Rich or Die Trying Mentality of Making Money Online in Kenya").

Some of the jobs that you can do to start making money online in Kenya include:

- Data entry jobs
- freelance writing
- paid online surveys
- Forums and blogs posting among others
