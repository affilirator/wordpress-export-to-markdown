You are probably on this page because you have heard of an **opportunity** to make money going by the name of DiPEK, and you would like to know more about it.

If that is the case, I have got news for you.

A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of meeting one of my customers who is also a member of **Pillar Technologies ltd DIPEK program**. Her explanation of how the DIPEK program works and the earning opportunities the program presents to Kenyans blew me away. I mean, if there was ever a system created for Kenyans to **make honest money**, Dipek has to be at the very top.

Like you, I was a little hesitant of the program, largely because I have this deep distrust for [multilevel](https://mahinge.com/5-reasons-trust-internet-marketing-africa/) and [network marketing companies](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/). Most of them end up collapsing and leaving the last clique of members to join more broke than they initially were... but I have a lot of faith for the DIPEK program, and (trust me) coming from me, this has to be very very real.

## What is DIPEK?

DIPEK is an acronym for **Direct Intervention Program for Empowering Kenyans**.

The program is a brainchild of a renown Kenyan company by the name of Pillar Technologies, and yes it is a multilevel/networking marketing company based right here in Kenya.

If you have not heard of network or multilevel marketing before, here is a simple explanation of the concept from the [Federal Trade Commission's website](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/multilevel-marketing "FTC")

> There are multi-level marketing plans – and then there are pyramid schemes. Before signing on the dotted line, study the company’s track record, ask lots of questions, and seek out independent opinions about the business.

> In multilevel or network marketing, individuals sell products to the public — often by word of mouth and direct sales. Typically, distributors earn commissions, not only for their own sales, but also for sales made by the people they recruit.

## Does DIPEK Fit into the FTC's Definition of Genuine Network Marketing Companies?

Definitely. This is the only reason that I am writing about Dipek in a positive light. If things were different, you can rest assured that this review would have been in a very different tone.

Although I am always against network marketing companies and have dedicated a better part of this blog to busting them, DIPEK falls under the category of network marketing companies that I can trust with my hard earned money.

Here is a quick checklist that I use to analyze every network marketing opportunity before I make up my mind whether it is worth my time and money:

1. Does the network marketing company have a genuine product that it sells?
2. Is the product that the MLM company sells in demand, and is it fairly priced?
3. Does the company have more than one avenue of revenue?
4. Does the MLM company offer training opportunities to new marketers?

After my keen analysis of the DIPEK program, I can assure you that it passes all of the above criteria.

For starters, the company deals with a commodity that every one wants-**airtime**. No matter which part of the country you are, Mandera, Wajir or Marsabit, cellphone airtime is a commodity that we use on a daily basis. Almost everyone in Kenya uses a cellphone and loads airtime on it. A lot of us use more than 500/= on airtime every month, which is the condition imposed by DIPEK for you to continue being a member of the company.

I might have not advised you to join DIPEK when they were only dealing with Orange airtime only but the company has now grown to an extent where it pays for the use of airtime from all mobile phone network providers in Kenya. That is a big big plus on the part of the company.

DIPEK also allows you to make money both from recruiting new members and from loading airtime on your mobile phone. When is the last time that Safaricom paid you to use their airtime?

## How Does one Become a Member of DIPEK?

Registration for the DIPEK membership is very easy. You will need 5,000/=, which will be used to purchase your starter kit. The kit will come with instructions on how to activate your account.

However, like all Multilevel Marketing (MLM) opportunities, you need to be invited to DIPEK by someone who is already a member of the company. If you do not know someone who is already a member, contact me using the details provided on the [contacts page](https://mahinge.com/contact-blogscheme/ "Contact Me"), and I will hook you up with a team that genuinely cares about your success in DIPEK.
