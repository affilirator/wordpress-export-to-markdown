![cma licensed forex brokers in kenya](images/cma-licensed-forex-brokers-in-kenya.jpg)

The Capital Markets Authority of Kenya (CMA) is the regulatory authority for the forex market in Kenya.

It is responsible for ensuring that all forex brokers operating in Kenya meet the required regulatory standards. This includes ensuring that brokers have sufficient capital to protect traders and that they operate in a fair and transparent manner.

The CMA also publishes a list of licensed brokers, which allows traders to easily identify reputable brokers.

While the CMA does not provide any guarantees about the safety of funds deposited with a broker, it does provide some protection. For example, if a broker becomes insolvent, the CMA will ensure that traders are able to withdraw their funds. In addition, the CMA regularly reviews brokers to ensure that they are still meeting the required standards.

Overall, the CMA plays an important role in safeguarding traders and ensuring a fair and transparent forex market.
