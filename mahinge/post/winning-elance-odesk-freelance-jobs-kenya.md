Today I would like to share **five super tips** that will help you **win high paying [online jobs](https://mahinge.com/ "online jobs in Kenya") in Elance and [oDesk](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/www.odesk.com "odesk")**. Remember, no matter how much information you cram in your head, if you do not make a point of [taking action](https://mahinge.com/make-money-online-kenya/ "taking action") you are as good as the person who doesn't know anything at all.

[Elance and oDesk](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelance writing jobs") are two of the most promising places for online jobs in Kenya. If you have access to a computer and internet connection plus loads of time on your hands, you should try launching a freelance career in Elance and oDesk.

But what does it really take to turn freelance writing into a source of income that is not only sustainable but also constant?

- **Bid for jobs on a daily basis**

You are probably considering the world of freelance jobs because you probably graduated from college and have been tarmacking with little success.

You have probably grown tired of dropping your CV's to employment bureaus in Nairobi.

Welcome to the other type of tarmacking, only this time, you can do it at the comfort of your home or the office where you are doing your internship, if it has an internet connection.

I would be lying if I tell you that you will get jobs on your first twenty proposals. Employers have this fear and distrust for beginners.

It is the same everywhere, online and offline. Keep bidding for jobs, and soon enough, you will land your first job after which, winning jobs will be a smooth sail if you keep doing it right.

I have actually discovered that a lot of freelancers fail on oDesk and Elance because they never bid for jobs or they do it the wrong way.

Both Elance and Odesk give you specific number of proposals that you can send per week or per month. For oDesk, there is a maximum of 25 proposals per week while Elance allows for 40 job proposals per month. Divide this number by the number of days that you need to work and send that amount of proposals daily. Make sure you exhaust the number of proposals you have set to send each day.

-              **Write laser-tailored and awesome job proposals**

Your proposal needs to be laser-tailored to the freelance job being advertised. If for instance the clients wants an article about bitcoins, do not send a proposal that simply says, "I can do this job"...

What I usually do when I am writing my job proposals is assume that I am a very enthusiastic salesman trying to sell _**a commodity that I know absolutely rocks and will undoubtedly add value to my prospects life**_.

I awe the client with my language, I try to tell them why they should really let me handle their project as opposed to any other freelance writer.

I tell them how awesome I am and how they would have made a bad decision if they do not pick me for their project. I try to be as awesome as I possibly can when I am writing my proposals, and guess what? 99.99% of the time, it works!

-  ****Stay online****
    
    \[caption id="attachment\_4164" align="alignright" width="300"\][![stay online if you want to win freelance writing jobs in Elance and odesk](images/stay-online-if-you-want-to-win-freelance-writing-jobs-in-Elance-and-odesk-300x151.jpg)](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stay-online-if-you-want-to-win-freelance-writing-jobs-in-Elance-and-odesk.jpg) Stay online!\[/caption\]

Honestly, I have not seen a freelancer who has grown their career when they are offline 50% of the time. This is not a chances game. It is not even a hit and run affair.

Let me give it to you straight, if you do not have internet access through a computer for at least 12-24 hours daily, forget about wanting to make an online income through freelance jobs.

You have to invest in the most bareback computer and modem if you want to get to the point where you can rely solely on freelance jobs for your income.

-  ****Go for what you are most talented in****

One of the freelance fields that always has a flood of open jobs is **freelance writing**. But does this mean that we should all flock here?

No.

Don't force yourself into a job category that does not suit you.

Freelance jobs come in many categories including admin and support, graphics and design, web design and programming among others.

Choose one that you believe you can perform optimally and stick with it.

- **Do not give up**

\[caption id="attachment\_4166" align="alignright" width="300"\][![freelance writing jobs demand that you do not give up](images/freelance-writing-jobs-demand-that-you-do-not-give-up-300x199.jpg)](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/freelance-writing-jobs-demand-that-you-do-not-give-up.jpg) Whatever you do, don't give up.\[/caption\]

You might have heard of that miner who after digging a trench for miles and miles, finally gave up while the gold vein was only a few inches on the other side of the tunnel. Whatever you do, do not give up!

The job bid that you would have placed tomorrow was probably the application that was gonna win you the first job on Elance. There is money in freelancing. Other people are banking it all the time. Why shouldn't you?
