## Is Hubpages Income the New Cash Cow For Writers?

Every writer's dream is to make money from the creativity. Fortunately, the internet has opened a lot of avenues for writers to benefit from their masterpieces.

One of these avenues is what is commonly referred as **revenue sharing websites.** Hubpages is one of these revenue sharing websites. Unfortunately, many newbie writers and bloggers and other online job seekers, do not posses this information. They waste their time trying to get approval from the popular and well paying affiliate programs such as Google Adsense or trying to land a genuine online job. [Enter Hubpages](http://www.hubpages.com/_crypticwrites) however, and your dream of working and making money online comes to a joyous end!

## Find out how I earned my first $100 online

Like I have stated on many other posts, I started writing and posting my content into many online writing forums from as long as I knew how to boot and use a computer.

There is nothing wrong in trying the [online writing forums](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "online writing jobs") and for some time I actually [![hubpages income](https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-nq4-CMyswdY%2FUTblr1630pI%2FAAAAAAAAAS4%2FxV29SvCCnhE%2Fs320%2Fhubpages.jpg&container=blogger&gadget=a&rewriteMime=image%2F*)](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/_2smf1azyvz2df)enjoyed seeing my pieces in the cyberspace labyrinths which by the way is all good and offers good writing practice for any aspiring writer. My online work however mostly went unpaid, and mostly unrecognized. This caused a lot of frustrations and a massive subsequent burnout and I kept off writing for quite sometime.

Friends and relatives who I used to share my content with might have noticed the retrogression and called me to it. One of my friends proposed that I [join Hubpages](http://www.hubpages.com/_crypticwrites "hubpages"). He had joined the program one month earlier and was already reaping massive benefits from it. Traffic to his blog had nearly tripled, and he had just cashed out his first hubpages income of $100 from [Paypal](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/www.paypal.com "Paypal"). Needless to say I reluctantly, almost half-heartedly, joined hubpages. I wrote my first 50 hubs and started noticing some income trickling into [my Paypal account](https://mahinge.com/best-way-to-withdraw-money-paypal-kenya/ "My Paypal account"). After one month, it was all Voila as I cahed my first $67 from Paypal, all paid by Hubpages! There I started recognizing my worth, not only as a recognizable web publisher, but also as a writer who could earn from his work.
