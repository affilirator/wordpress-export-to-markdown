> _You are on your way to becoming a millionaire... Just get 30 people to click on your Earn4Youth referral link and you pocket a cool $300! You can surely get 30 clicks in one day.... A cool 24K on a fckuing daily basis._

> _You are surely a genius!_

No, you are not :-)

The above reminds me of one of my favorite movies: [**Now You See Me, Now You Don't**](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tt1670345 "Now You See Me, Now You Don't"). I am tempted to include several anecdotes from the award-winning Movie here. They will probably jolt you back to reality.

There is no way you are going to earn $10 just by having a stranger click on a dubious referral link. You should slap yourself across the face for believing that you can make online money so easily.

Movies and the sarcasm aside. I seriously pity you if you have been suckered into the **Earn4Youth Scam**.

If you are busy sharing Earn4Youth referral links, you are wasting a good chunk of your time that you could be using to write [bestselling Kindle Ebooks](https://academy.mahinge.com/course/how-to-make-money-selling-simple-kindle-ebooks/ "KIndle bestsellers"). Worse still, you are making your Facebook and Twitter friends waste their time (_and the costly internet data bundles_) following your links to the scam. In doing so, you are also eroding a very crucial component of social media friendships, trust and reliability.

- **_But I am not being asked to pay anything to join Earn4Youth. How then can it be a scam?_**

That's my very point. Earn4Youth.com is worse than the likes of [SocialBizConnect(SBC)](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/ "socialbizconnect") and [Internet Marketing Africa](https://mahinge.com/5-reasons-trust-internet-marketing-africa/ "Internet Marketing Africa") that ask you to pay a monthly contribution of 4K. At least, with SBC and IMA, you are guaranteed to get some morsels off Kimathi Kamundeh's high table if you do his dirty bidding.

In Earn4Youth, you will only see your money pile into the dubious account to the highly anticipated $300, but you will never manage to withdraw any of it. That's when it hits you, "_**I have been scammed**_"...

> BTW, I didn't say that you can join SBC and IMA... Do it at your own risk!

## What's their Goal?

> The more you look, the less you see.

Ahh ^^ there goes a quote from the movie...

I am sure you must ask yourself this question from time to time, especially if you have been drawn into these referral link scams.

1. They do not seem to steal money from you.
2. They do not require any of your bank details to pull a heist on you when you least expect it.
3. So, what is the goal of the scam?
4. Are they a clique of Macho sadists who enjoy to see you waste loads of time sharing links on Facebook and track how low you can go to earn your first online dollar?

I wish they were this but they are not.

Whoever is behind the Earn4Youth scam is a scheming online entrepreneur who earns money from the traffic that you drive to his/her website. In fact, this seems to be the only goal of the Earn4Youth scam and other scams (PayFunda, Monthly Youth, Youth2Payment among others) that are replicas of it.

Here is how you are making the owner of the website richer, and comprising your identity and computer.

- **Adverts**\-There is an ad on the immediate homepage of the Earn4Youth website. There are two other advertisements on your supposed dashboard. Whenever you view/click on this ad, the owner gets a few pennies from the advertisers.

If you bring 30 friends to the website, who bring their 30 friends who also bring their 3o friends who view/click the adverts on the scammy website, the owners of Earn4Youth get paid by the advertisers! Wherever he is, he must be stinking rich and laughing himself all the way to the bank.

- **Completing surveys**\- 'Members' who have worked through their first $300 report of a requirement to [complete online surveys in order to get paid](https://mahinge.com/online-scam-surveys/ "Online surveys")! Someone is getting paid for every online survey that you complete... but it is obviously not you. Guess who?

And here is how you are compromising your online security and your computer.

- **Installing Malware on your computer**\- This has to be the saddest part of the Earn4Youth scam. Most of the ads displayed on the website will install malware on your computer when you click on them. Once installed, the Malware has the capability to do hundreds of nasty things in your computer including but not limited to recording the keystrokes you make on your keyboard, stealing your passwords, and serving you pornography!
- **Giving your information on an insecure page**\-Here is a little tip I will steal for you.

> If a website does not have an SSL certificate on their login or registration pages, run for the mountains!

Websites with SLL certificates display their address on the address bar of your browser as **https:**//mahinge.com. If I didn't have an [SSL certificate](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/what-is-an-ssl-certificate), you would see my website as **http:**//mahinge.com.

Any data you send on the internet without an SSL certificate is insecure. It can be hijacked by anyone including the malware you already have on your computer!

Never enter any sensitive information such as your PayPal Email address or credit card information onÂ  a website that does not use an SSL certificate.

- **Giving your information to third parties**\-Apart from making money from the traffic you send to their website, scams such as Earn4Youth also make money from selling your contact details to third party advertises, most of whom also happen to be scammers. If you receive emails about having won money online or named as one of the heirs to a posh estate, please ignore it.
