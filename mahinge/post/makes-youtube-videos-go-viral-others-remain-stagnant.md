## **Video Tags and Description**

Your tags need to match the keyword research we talked about in Part 1 of our YouTube optimization guide. Use keywords that are part of your overall marketing strategy to connect all of your platforms. Also use keywords specific to this video and for YouTube search results.

The description needs to include these keywords as well, along with a few other things:

- Using keywords in your description gives another boost to your SEO.
- Descriptions let viewers know what you are offering.
- Only the first 160 characters will show up right under the video without clicking Read More. It will also be the only part that shows up on search engines, so optimize the first two sentences with your keywords.
- It works best when you use the same keywords at the beginning of your title and description.
- Place a call to action at the end of the description.
- Include links to the previous or next video.

**\[highlight\]Quick Stat\[/highlight\]:** 100 million people take a social action on YouTube every week.

**\[highlight\]Important Tip:\[/highlight\]** Do not be stingy on the description. You have a lot of space and you need to use it! Always add links to your website, blog, and social media profiles at the bottom of the description.

##  **Playlists**

Remember all the different kinds of content you can create from Part 1? You can divide the different types of content into playlists. This allows followers to get to the content they want to see. And, since playlists automatically go to the next video in the set, they may stick around and give your videos more views. Some good examples of playlist categories include:

1. Products
2. Work Life
3. Industry News
4. How-To’s
5. Charity
6. Client Testimonials

\[highlight\]Stat: \[/highlight\]Playlists increase engagement and tie into your video content strategy.

**\[highlight\]Tip:\[/highlight\]** Get creative with your playlists! Make sure your categories fit the personality of your brand. So, if your brand is funny, make your playlists funny. If your brand is quirky, make the playlists quirky.

##  **Engagement**

 The most important key to success with a YouTube marketing plan is engagement. When your viewers are engaged with the videos, they will explore the brand and become loyal followers. This is done a number of ways, including creating great content, but starting a conversation with your viewers is one of the best. When you interact with your audience, they feel valued by the brand and will become loyal to it. Here are three ways you can start conversations on YouTube:

1. **1.**      **Give updates.** When you upload a video about something that is happening in with your brand, update the description on how it is going, or create a new video about it. Make sure to link to the new video in the old video’s description and annotations.
2. **2.**      **Respond to channel comments.** Your channel is going to act as a discussion board for your brand. Take some time every week to go through the channel comments and reply to questions or great comments. Even reply to negative comments, but do so professionally. Do not start a flame war.
3. **3.**      **Respond to video comments.** Video comments are more specific than channel comments. The three days after you upload a video, respond to a few comments a day. Then check back on the video every few days for two weeks to respond to comments until you upload a new video.

**\[highlight\]Stat:\[/highlight\]** Over 800 million unique users visit YouTube each month.

**\[highlight\]Tip:\[/highlight\]** Not only do you need to start conversations, you need to be active in commenting. This makes your brand seem human and likeable.

## **Promote**

 You need to promote on three platforms: subscriptions, social media, and cross promotion. Promoting these three ways will help you build audience touch points and loyalty among your viewers. This is similar to the call to action we talked about in Part 2.

1. **1.**      **Subscriptions.** At the end of each video, either tell people or have an ending screen that tells people to subscribe to see more of this kind of content. End each video with an exciting look at upcoming videos so they will be more willing to subscribe.
2. **2.**      **Social Media.** Have buttons in your video, description, and channel that tell people to click to share the content or click to follow your brand on other platforms.
3. **3.**      **Cross Promotion.**Not only should you ask viewers to share content on social media, you should also share it on your own platforms. Every time you upload a new video, share it on Facebook, Twitter, your blog, and any other social media platform you use.

**\[highlight\]Quick Stat:\[/highlight\]** 500 years of YouTube video are watched every day on Facebook while over 700 YouTube videos are shared on Twitter every minute.

**\[highlight\]Important Tip:\[/highlight\]** Instead of directly telling viewers to share your videos (which can get in the way of quality content), create an ending image that says they should like, comment, favorite, and share on certain social media site. Use annotations to put outside links on this screen.

## **Analyze**

 Analyzing how well your YouTube marketing campaign is doing is an essential piece of success.

When you look at the statistics, you can see what areas you are struggling with and what areas you are excelling. This allows you to make changes where you need to and don’t mess with things that are working well. YouTube analytics will measure:

- **Performance  
    **YouTube will tell you how many views each video and all of your videos. They will also tell you how many minutes have been spent watching your videos and subscribers net change.
    
- **Engagement  
    **YouTube measures engagement in Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Shares, Favorites Added, and Favorites Removed.
    
- **Top 10 Videos  
    **YouTube will not only tell you the top 10 videos on your account, but will break down their ranks by views, minutes watched, and Likes.

**\[highlight\]Quick Stat: \[/highlight\]**More video is uploaded to YouTube in one month than the 3 major US networks created in 60 years**.**

**\[highlight\]Important Tip:\[/highlight\]** There is a pattern you need to follow for a successful YouTube marketing campaign – strategize, create, optimize, promote, and analyze. This is a circle that never ends.
