## Why Are Peace Lily Leaves Turning Black?

You may be wondering why your peace lily leaves are starting to turn black. The question 'what causes peace lily leaves to turn black is common among people with these beautiful household plants. The reasons for peace lily leaves turning black could vary and may be among the potential ones discussed below.

### Aging

Peace lilies also age as other plants do. Aging means that the plant has lived for a long time and can no longer live or produce as before. Old age could be one of the potential causes of your peace lily leaves turning black, brown, or even yellow. The leaves will turn black before falling off. And this should not worry you.

Aging is a natural phenomenon that affects all living things, including other plants. Aging will also be a potential cause for water lily leaves turning black. You can't stop or control the aging of peace lilies. The best you can do when you notice the peace lily leaves turning black due to old age is to prune them to maintain the good green look of the plant.

### Watering Problems

Watering issues can also be the reason for your peace lily leaves turning black. Water lilies tend to consume quite a lot of water. Hence, they need enough water throughout. With inadequate water, you may notice the peace lily leaves turning black. Water deprivation is also noticeable through the peace lily tips turning brown.

Giving too much water to peace lilies may also cause the same problem. If your peace lilies are potted, having too much water in the soil could cause suffocation of the roots. You may then start noticing the peace lily leaves turning brown. The leaves could then end up becoming black.

### Poor Water Quality

Poor water quality could also be behind your peace lily leaves turning black. And this is quite likely if you use ordinary tap water to water your plants. Often, tap water has chemicals like chlorine and fluorine that alter its PH. And this means that the tap water could have excessive concentrations of these chemicals. Hence the reason for your peace lily leaves turning black.

As you continue using tap water on your peace lilies, high concentrations of nutrients and chemicals could accumulate in the soil. And this can then inhibit water absorption by the plant's roots. Essentially, the water lilies will not be getting enough water. Without adequate water, the plant will ultimately die, and the leaves will start turning black before that happens.

### Pests

If you water your plants well but notice the peace lily leaves turning black, it may indicate a pest attack. Pests like spider mites, mealybugs, scale insects, and aphids are common on peace lilies.

Pests puncture the peace lily plant and suck its moisture, causing the leaves to turn brown, black, or yellow. The pests hide under the leaves, mainly below the black or brown spots. A peace lily black flower could also indicate a pest attack. Likewise, a peace lily back stem could be showing a pest infestation.

### Root Rot

Fungal root rot is also a common cause of your peace lily leaves turning black. The fungal root rot is often caused by overwatering your peace lily plant. When you water the plant too much and too often, the soil becomes soggy, suffocating the roots. The problem could also be due to poor drainage.

Besides noticing the soil is too soggy, look for other symptoms like swollen and drooping leaves. You may also check the roots closely by uprooting one or a few of the peace lilies to have a closer look.

### Over-fertilizing

Are you using chemical fertilizers on your peace lilies? It could be another potential cause of the peace lily leaves turning black. Specifically, using too much chemical fertilizer affects the PH and mineral composition in the soil. The mineral composition will rise with high fertilizer use, while the PH will drop. And this adversely affects water and nutrient absorption by the plant's roots.

Additionally, the chemical fertilizers could end up causing chemical burns to the roots of the peace lilies. The leaves end up dying and hence the turning to black color. The same issue could arise if you use too much-concentrated chemical fertilizer on the peace lilies.
