## Why Do Apples Grow in Cold Climates?

It is not uncommon to wonder why do apples grow in cold climates. As a farmer or gardener, you may also ask, can apples grow in cold weather? Well, multiple studies and even experiences of individual farmers prove apples often do best in cold climates. The following are the top explanations for why do apples grow in cold climates?

### Natural Defense Mechanism

As hinted above, cold climate fruit trees such as apples have a unique genome structure, with a natural defense mechanism that enables them to resist freezing temperatures. And this partly answers the question, why do apples grow in cold climates? The genetic trait that gives apples that protection is called cold hardiness. The apple tree's cells start to break down when exposed to below-freezing temperatures. However, they can quickly rebuild the cells if the temperatures remain below 15 degrees Fahrenheit for a long.

### Cold Weather Keeps Pests and Diseases Away

Pest and diseases are also vital to consider when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates? Like other fruit trees, apples usually attract many pests and diseases. While pests and insects can thrive in varying climatic conditions, cold temperatures significantly slow their reproduction. Apple scab is one of the common fungal diseases affecting apples that you can easily avoid whenever you grow fruits in cold weather. Cold temperatures make the plant inhabitable to most pests and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, keeping the fruits healthy. Thus, this factor also answers the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

### Better Access to Water and Nutrients

Apples also do best in cold temperatures because they require more nutrients and water to maintain proper growth and development in freezing conditions. So, water and nutrients access is a vital consideration when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates? Unlike dry climates, cold weather enables plants to access plenty of water from rainfall, snow, and nutrients from the soil.

Like most fruits and vegetables that grow in cold climates, the freezing temperatures allow apples to collect and retain lots of water and nutrients, essential to producing healthy and juicy fruits. Besides, that implies that plants do not struggle to find adequate nutrients and water for optimal growth and development. Again, this partly answers the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

However, that could also make you ask, do apples grow in winter? Apples can survive a cold snap for a few hours, but prolonged exposure to below-freezing temperatures can harm the fruits. A build-up of frost can quickly kill tender blossoms and weaken mature fruits. Although cold temperatures allow apples better access to water and nutrients, exposure to cold conditions can slow their growth and development.

## Cold Weather Impacts on Apples

To understand why do apples grow in cold climates, you should also know how freezing temperatures impact the fruits' overall growth and development. Thanks to their natural defense mechanism, apples can survive cold temperatures. However, below-freezing temperatures expose the plants to risks that every farmer should understand.

Freezing climates can lead to smaller crop yields, leaving you with a small fraction of hardier fruits. Below-freezing temperatures can induce a heavy toll on the plants, weakening and killing them. [Advection freeze](https://site.extension.uga.edu/climate/2018/01/comparing-advective-and-radiative-freezes/) and radiation freeze are the two events to consider when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

Advection freeze occurs when a dry, cold air mass hits, with strong winds at night and early morning. That radiates away the heat held in the soil and within the plant. A radiation freeze occurs when a layer of cold, dry air forms under a layer of warm air on clear and calm nights. That can make the plant much colder, causing damage.

Frost is another thing you should be careful about when growing apples in cold weather. In the early season, a frost build-up on the plants can significantly slow their growth. The frost that hits at such times can form rusty brown patches on the fruits. The blemishes may not impact the apples' flavor but can damage the fruits. Thus, frost is a vital consideration when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

Farmers who grow apples in cold climates should always look for weather forecasts to know when to apply frost or snow protection measures. The best methods for tackling freezing temperatures include covers, water applications, wind machines, and heaters. So, cold weather impact is a vital consideration when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

## Apple Growing Conditions

You want to know the growing conditions for apple tree when asking, why do apples grow in cold climates? There are thousands of apple varieties with varying growing conditions. However, apple trees also share certain essential traits that enable them to tolerate similar conditions. And that can make it a bit confusing to tell the ideal apple tree climate zone. So, what climates do apples grow best in?

## Growing Apples in Cold Climates

Where do apples do best? They primarily prefer temperate climates with cooler summers and long frost-free growing seasons. The ideal temperatures should range between 10-18 degrees Celsius. Apples usually bloom and produce fruit in autumn, so they need the temperatures to remain low enough to facilitate pollination and prevent damage to the blossoms.

Several apple varieties usually need at least three months without cold weather. That ensures the buds do not die off prematurely due to freezing temperatures. And this is essential to consider when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

Heavy or prolonged rains usually deliver more giant, plush apples, ideal for juicing. However, excessive rainfall can produce apple fruits with softer textures, more vulnerable to bruising. Too much moisture during and after the maturity stage can induce molding that could kill all the apples.

Although apples mainly thrive in cold climates, they can also survive in moderate to warmer climates. That is because apples also have a reputation as autumn fruit crops that can tolerate a wide range of temperature fluctuations. Nonetheless, extreme weather swings could alter the sweet flavor of the fruits. Therefore, they are vital considerations when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

## Growing Apples in the Tropics

So, can apples grow in a tropical climate? Yes, apples can grow in tropical weather, and people have cultivated them in such conditions for decades. However, growing apples in the tropics require you to meet specific requirements for better yields. Which, again, partly answers the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

The first condition for growing apples in a tropical climate is to ensure that the temperatures do not go beyond 5 degrees Celsius and 12 degrees Celsius or 41 degrees Fahrenheit and 54 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are growing quick-yield apple varieties such as Granny Smith or Pink Lady, the temperatures should not drop below 4 degrees Celsius.

When answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates, is also essential to grow the apples in tropical areas with enough rainfall throughout the year, so they remain watered even during the dry periods. Proper spacing is also crucial when planting apple trees to ensure that the dense foliage does not prevent light from reaching all your plants.

While apples can grow in tropical climates under the above conditions, there are some potential shortcomings. Tropical climates generally give apples a hard time growing and developing. The temperatures keep the soil compact, moist, and hot, inhibiting the tree from establishing roots properly. Which also answers the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?

Besides, the high humidity levels impact poor air circulation around the plant, slowing growth and development. Apples grown in tropical climates will likely taste differently since the temperatures can interfere with the flavors. And this consideration is also vital when answering the question, why do apples grow in cold climates?
