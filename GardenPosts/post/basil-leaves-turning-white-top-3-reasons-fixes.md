Basil is one of the most coveted vegetables, mainly grown for its leaves used in cooking. As such, basil leaves turning white signifies problems, and you should take it very seriously. So, what does it mean when basil leaves turn white? [Gardenterprise](https://garden.gnmnetworks.com/) offers insights to help you to understand why are the leaves on my basil plant turning white and how to address the problems effectively. 

Many questions come to mind whenever you see your basil turning white. The first question is usually why basil leaves turn white. There are two main reasons for basil leaves turning white: fungal infections or insect infestation. Basil leaves attract many insects, including spider mites, mealybugs, leafhoppers, thrips, aphids, and whiteflies. 

Insects usually cause irregular and random damage to the plant leaves, but the spots do not become significant with time. However, fungal infections start as small patches that spread onto the leaf surface, creating more significant marks that eventually cover the entire leaf. If your basil leaves are tuning white with similar signs, the reasons are definitely due to fungal or insect infestation. However, nutrient deficiencies can also be a reason behind basil leaves turning white. 

### 1.     Common Basil Diseases 

Disease infestation is one of the main reasons why basil leaves turn white. Diseases usually start as uniform spots on the leaf surfaces, creating powdery mildew. In contrast, what does it mean when basil leaves turn yellow? Or, why basil leaves turning black should concern you. 

Yellow indicates downy mildew, while black or brown represents bacterial leaf spots or fusarium. The areas will increase in size and eventually cover the entire leaves if you don't address the issue on time. Here are the common basil diseases and their symptoms to help you to understand what it means when basil leaves turn white.  

#### _Powdery_ _Mildew Basil_ 

Powdery mildew is the most prevalent disease that causes white basil leaves. It often occurs during cool nights and warm days. The infection begins as small white spots on the upper leaf surface and spreads to cover the entire leaf with a powder-like coating. The disease grows fast on tender fresh leaves, so you should regulate fertilization to prevent the spread.

Although powdery mildew does not impact permanent plant damage, that could occur in severe cases. Perhaps, you are also wondering whether white spots on basil leaves are safe to eat. Please don't eat basil with white areas caused by powdery mildew. 

#### _Downy Mildew_ 

Downy mildew is another common disease that usually manifests through basil leaves turning yellow white. It starts as small yellow patches on the leaf surface. Downy mildew spreads through wind, developing a fuzzy gray growth on the bottom of the leaves that will then drop off. The development may look like a layer of dirt, but a closer look can help you to spot it on time.

Warm temperatures and high humidity levels can accelerate downy mildew development, with Holy basil leaves turning brown. 

Usually, contaminated seeds and infected leaves introduce it to the plants. However, wind can also disperse it to healthy plants. Downy mildew progresses rapidly and can finish off your plants quickly if you don't treat them immediately and effectively. 

#### _Fusarium wilt_ 

Fusarium wilt is among the most devastating fungal infections on basil. A soil-borne pathogen called Fusarium oxysporum causes it, and contaminated seeds and soils can introduce and spread it. One of the reasons for its devastation is that the disease can survive over a more extended period as pores, causing new infections. It mainly manifests through fresh basil leaves turning brown, with twisted stems and stunted growth.

#### _Bacterial Leaf Spot_ 

You may wonder, what does it mean when basil leaves turn brown? In that case, focus more on bacterial leaf spots. The disease's symptoms include brown and black water-soaked spots on the leaves and parts of the stems. Fresh basil leaves turning black can also signify bacterial leaf spots. The marks are irregular and can spread to the entire leaf surface over time. 

#### _Gray M__old_ 

Gray mold is the answer to why are my basil leaves turning gray. Its symptoms include brownish to grayish fungal growth on the leaves and stem. While it may be confused with downy mildew, gray mold is usually denser and fuzzier. You will notice the basil leaves turning gray, wilting, and eventually falling off the plant. The entire plant may die if the disease becomes severe and develops on the main stem. 

### 2.     Basil Insects and Pests 

Insect and pest infestations also have a more significant role to play in the discoloration of plant leaves. They cause damage by feeding on the plant leaves, creating small white spots on the upper leaf surfaces. Some insects and pests can multiply very quickly and overwhelm the plant, and could be the reason behind the basil leaves turning white. That implies you should conduct frequent inspections on your basil plants to identify and stop them on time. Nonetheless, the following are the common pests and insects behind basil leaves turning white. 

#### _Aphids_ 

Aphids usually thrive in colonies, feeding on plant leaves and stems. While white aphids are the most common varieties, other colors also exist. The insects suck juices from the basil leaves, creating small and irregular spots on the leaf surfaces. And this can also be the reason behind the basil leaves turning white.

#### _Spider Mites_ 

Spider mites are tiny pests that feed on basil leaves and stems. Although detecting them can be extremely difficult, you can quickly tell spider mites' infestation through small dots on the leaf surfaces. Thus, spider mites can be the reason behind the basil leaves turning white.

#### _Leafhoppers_ 

Like other basil pests and insects, leaf hoppers also such juices from the leaves, creating small white dots across the surface. Their wedge-shaped bodies and quick movements make them quite hard to spot. However, the damage caused by those insects looks like trails or channels on the surface. Hence, a possible reason behind the basil leaves turning white. 

#### _Thrips_ 

Thrips are tinier and slender pets that often hide inside new buds or on the leaf undersides. Infestations can sometimes cause the leaves to close up. Thrips leave irregular silvery or white spots across the leaf surface. Infested leaves also turn brown as they degenerate and die. 

#### _Mealybugs_ 

Mealy bugs are also tiny and white. The pests often live in leaf axils and crotches from where they suck off plant juices. Unlike the other basil pests, mealybugs are tropical insects that do not thrive in cold temperatures. However, they can devastate plants grown indoors or in warm outdoor environments. Hence, a possible reason behind the basil leaves turning white.  

#### _Whiteflies_ 

Whiteflies have light-colored bodies that appear as white spots. Although they feed on plant leaves, white flies are less invasive than most pests. You can quickly drive them away from your basil plant by shaking it. 

### 3.     Nutrient Deficiencies 

The lack of or inadequate nutrients can also cause discoloration of basil leaves. However, different colors represent unique nutrient deficiencies. So, what causes basil leaves to turn brown? Or, what does it mean when basil leaves turn yellow? Brown or purple spots on basil leaves are symptoms of phosphorus deficiency. 

Basil leaves turning yellow indicate a lack of iron or nitrogen. Basil leaves turning pale green could also mean a deficiency in some nutrients. Nonetheless, the resulting spots and discoloration on the leaves become dead over time as the conditions persist, eventually turning brittle and fading to white. 

Unlike diseases, pests, and insects, detecting nutrient deficiencies in plants requires more detailed diagnostic approaches. Instead of rushing to add nutrients to the plants, you should first conduct a proper soil test. That will enable you to determine and supplement the deficient nutrients with the utmost accuracy and precision. Once you notice the nutrient deficiency behind the basil leaves turning white, add the appropriate fertilizer.
