## Essential Garden Supplies

A home garden provides many things for a family. Besides being an excellent source of healthy foods, a home garden is a place to relax and enjoy fresh air and beauty. Here are the essential garden supplies to buy to ensure a successful gardening journey.

### Soil

Soil is a garden supply that gardeners must have to start their gardening journey. Whether you choose garden or [potting soil](https://garden.gnmnetworks.com/how-to-store-potting-soil/), ensure it’s organic to maximize biodiversity in its composition and avoid contaminants. Potting soil suits containers or pots of all sizes and shapes. However, it’s soil-less. It mostly has three ingredients, which are pine bark, peat moss, and perlite. Garden soil is ideal for raised garden beds or the ground. It’s dense and heavy. Also, it doesn’t facilitate the necessary drainage for containers. It contains topsoil and other nutrients or materials to facilitate plant development.

### Garden Tools

You need garden tools to dig holes, prune shrubs, remove weeds, turn soil, and more. The basic garden tools include a spade, shovel, and cultivator. When buying gardening tools, choose sturdy, metallic products with high-grade tempered steel heads and excellent grips. Also, consider tools with ergonomic handles.

You may need a garden fork for turning soil, a trowel for planting bulbs and digging holes, and a hoe for weed control. Also, invest in bypass pruners or anvil pruners to keep plants neat in your garden. You may also need landscaping supplies to design and develop a beautiful garden. Nevertheless, invest in quality garden tools to save money on their repair or replacement and ensure your safety when using them.

### Seeds or Seedlings

Once you have soil and gardening tools, invest in quality seeds or seedlings. Your choice of seeds or seedlings will depend on the crop you want to grow in your garden and the local climate. A local gardening expert can help you choose the best seeds or seedlings, set up a nursery, or plant the seedlings. Plant seedlings are ideal for beginners because they are easier to install.

However, you can grow only some plants from seeds or seedlings. Vegetables like tomatoes and spinach require seedlings. Carrots and most root vegetables require seeds. Therefore, ensure you know whether to buy seeds or seedlings. When purchasing seeds, ensure they are organic. Also, avoid GMOs when using transplants. Remember, organic plants have a better flavor and more nutrients, which are vital for a home garden.

### Fertilizers

Fertilizers provide the nutrients your plants need to grow strong and healthy. Failure to apply fertilizers can cause stunted growth, wilting, and dry leaves. Also, yields will drop due to the lack of vital nutrients. Therefore, invest in quality, organic fertilizers suitable for your plants at various growth stages. Fertilizers must supply the following essential nutrients to your plants:

- Nitrogen

- Potassium

- Phosphorus

Other nutrients your plants need include sulfur, calcium, and magnesium.

### Insecticides

A multipurpose insecticide is a vital garden supply for beginners. You’ll need it when you notice small spots on the plant leaves, fruit rot, leaves turning white, black, or brown, and other signs of pest infestation. An organic insecticide can help you deal with these problems and save your plants. Natural insecticides are non-toxic, and you can use them for up to a few days to harvesting. Please avoid using soap to control pests, since it’s only effective for a few begs. Also, soap can stick to the plant leaves, causing more problems including suffocation.

### Wagon or Garden Cart

When you buy garden supplies, you need something to move them around. You can use a single-wheel wheelbarrow to haul mulch, planters, or soil. Please ensure you have a cart of the right model and size for your garden work.

### A Garden Hose or Watering Can

A garden hose or a watering can is a vital garden supply for hydrating plants. The best watering can have a long spout to help you reach all the plants. Also, ensure its size is comfortable. A small one will require constant refilling, while a large one can be challenging to carry. Nevertheless, you need it to water small shrubs and container plants.

For a larger garden, you need a garden hose. Please buy a garden hose with durable material and an appropriate length. If it’s too short, you may have to move it around constantly. On the other hand, storing a long hose can be challenging.

Moreover, ensure the nozzle lets you control the spray range and water pressure via different settings. That way, you can water the plant heavily or lightly as needed. Additionally, choose a comfortable nozzle since some are challenging and stiff to operate.

### Gardening Gloves

You need gardening gloves to hold trowels or shovels without getting blisters. The best gardeners’ gloves have designs with extra padding for the palms, pointer fingers, and thumbs, making gripping the tools more comfortable. Also, balance protection and dexterity when buying gardening gloves.

### Weeder

A sturdy weeder is also a vital garden supply to buy when starting. It helps you pry up the weeds that hide in the ground cover. With this tool, you can remove roots from the soil, regardless of the taproot’s depth.

### Mulch

Mulching helps with weed control and soil moisture retention. When buying mulch, ensure it’s appropriate for the plant you want to grow in your garden. Also, apply it at the base of your trees or around the plants. You can use various types of mulch, including the following:

- Leaves

- Bark chips

- Grass clippings

- Straw

The best mulch protects delicate roots from fungal growth and extreme temperatures. Also, it helps the natural colors of the plant's flowers and leaves pop.

### Garden Twine

A roll of twine helps you tie tall plants, train small branches, and make trellises climb. Also, it helps you tie herb stems together, section off your [raised bed](https://garden.gnmnetworks.com/what-is-a-raised-bed-garden/), and mark your garden to maintain straight rows.

### Tub Trugs

A tub trug is a flexible plastic bucket that you can use for various activities, including weeding, pulling out mulch, holding tools, digging up gross things, and removing dead plants. Two to three tub trugs are ideal for beginners.

If you plan to grow plants indoors, your garden supply list may include plant containers or pots and grow light. Remember, indoor gardens may lack adequate sunlight or soil. Hence, additional supplies may be necessary for your garden to thrive.

## Tips for Choosing Your Garden Supply

Local and online stores have many garden supplies. Hence, determining what suits your gardening activity can be challenging. The following factors can help you pick the necessary gardening products.

### Garden Size and Needs

Your garden size and needs will influence your choice of fertilizers, tools, and hoses. For instance, you need a pair of pruning shears and a trowel if you have a small herb garden. On the other hand, you may need extra tools like a hoe, a garden fork, and a cultivator if you have a vegetable garden.

### Climate

Your climate zone should also help you choose the right garden supplies. For example, you may need watering tools and seeds for drought-resistant plants if you live in an arid region. If your region receives heavy rainfall, you may need plants that can resist fungi. The climate can also influence the soil type in your area. Therefore, please buy gardening equipment and soil supplements that enhance drainage and soil structure if you have thick clay soil.

### Quality

The quality of your garden supplies is also vital because it influences their longevity. Therefore, prioritize quality over price when shopping. Moreover, ensure the products suit your gardening needs to save money and minimize waste.

### Read Garden Supply Reviews

The market has many garden supply brands. Therefore, read reviews about various brands to choose products that other gardeners have tested and proven effective. Remember, you need your garden supplies to help you achieve your goals without spending a fortune. Hence, read reviews first to invest in superior products.

Paying attention to the quality of garden supplies is vital. Moreover, consider your garden’s specific needs and select the right tools for every job. Moreover, invest in organic options when buying fertilizers and insecticides.
