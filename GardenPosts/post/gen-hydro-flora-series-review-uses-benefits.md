### FloraGrow

FloraGrow provides additional potassium and nitrogen for foliar and structural growth. Together with the other formulas, it promotes vegetative growth and the development of more leaves and branches. Nevertheless, its primary focus is on foliar and structural growth with potassium, nitrogen, and secondary elements like sulfate and magnesium.

## Gen Hydro Flora Series Feed Chart

The General Hydroponics Flora Series chart has two sections. These are basic and expert sections. The basic feeding chart has Micro, Gro, and Bloom nutrients. Florakleen is for flushing the rooting system while Ripen is for the fattening duration. The expert chart has four additional additives for improving the results. When using the expert chart, please remember to incorporate expert and basic products.

Some additives and fertilizers can affect the pH of the nutrient solution. Moreover, use filtered or distilled water. Alternatively, ensure the mineral levels are incredibly low. Also, the chart indicates the [correct EC](https://garden.gnmnetworks.com/best-ec-meter-for-hydroponics-top-5-reviews/) levels for every dose and phase.

Each chart has plant phases instead of weeks. That way, following the chats is relatively easy, whether growing plants indoors or outdoors. Remember, these chats are for guidance purposes only. Hence, please respond to your plants’ health accordingly.

For instance, if you over-fertilize the plants accidentally, following the chart can be meaningless because they won’t absorb more nutrients. Additionally, the climate and plant type may require you to adjust the doses.
