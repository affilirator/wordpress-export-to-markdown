Mint leaves turning yellow is one of the main concerns farmers face. In some cases, the yellowing of mint leaves can lead to the death of the plant. In this regard, it is essential to know how to fix yellowing mint leaves. That way, you will have avoided the potential losses that emanate from the death of mint plants, especially if you are in commercial farming. The best thing is that mint leaves yellow spots are treatable since there are many remedies for mint leaves yellowing. The idea is to ensure that preventing yellowing in mint plants is executed promptly. 

People use mint mainly as a spice and is usually grown on large and small scales. Many farmers practice commercial mint farming globally. That means a significant challenge could be associated with mint leaves yellow spots, especially if it is all in the commercial domain. In other cases, mint leaves turning black could be the case. Either way, it is essential to acknowledge such issues with mint plants and implement the necessary remedies. So, why are mint leaves turning yellow? 

## Mint Leaves Turning Yellow: 7 Reasons 

It is acknowledgeable that mint is one of the easy-to-grow plants. However, as the plant quickly grows, some challenges may emanate. The main concern that faces most farmers is mint leaves turning yellow. Mint leaves turning yellow compromises the fragrance and taste. That means the problem affects the mint sensation you want to experience. Diagnosing yellow mint leaf yellowing is essential to establish the actual cause of the occurrence. Based on various scientific studies, here are among the common causes of yellow mint leaves: 

Inadequate Sunlight Any plant, including mint, depends on the central survival mechanism- photosynthesis. For photosynthesis to take place, adequate exposure to sunlight is needed. In essence, photosynthesis is the process under which sunlight generates food for a specific plant. That means inadequate sunlight supply stalls plant growth and development. The green pigment on the mint leaves is known as chlorophyll, whose role is to absorb sunlight to facilitate the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, inadequate sunlight leads to poor growth of the mint plant, which is equally the reason behind mint rust or yellowing formation. 

### 1.   Mint Rust 

Fungal attacks and rust are considered one of the common causes of mint leaf turning yellow. In this case, fungi and rust accumulated on the surface of the leaves and the stem. And this leads to destructive issues in the growth process of mint. Notably, mint rust and fungi attack lead to yellowing under the leaf surface. An extensive attack can lead to a total effect on the leaf and, by extension, the stem. [Studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254364696_Diseases_in_Mint_Causal_Organisms_Distribution_and_Control_Measures) indicate that the leading cause of mint rust is the death of mint tissue, leading to the falling off of the leaves. It is also possible that mint planted in a rust or fungi-infested environment may also be affected. 

### 2.   Bad Soil Composure 

It is important to note that soil has the nutrients that facilitate the growth and development of a plant. That's why some plants emerge fertile while others are malnourished. Ideally, the soil nutrient level is the primary determinant of the performance of a mint plant in the growth process. Deficiency in soil nutrients implies that there could be some growth defects evident in a mint plant. Usually, mint leaves do well in soils adequately supplied with nitrogen. Such soil is considered nutritionally rich, hence best in harboring healthy growth of mint. 

### 3.   Inadequate Water Supply 

Unlike some plants, mint hardly survives in dry areas. Therefore, mint farmers must regularly water the plants to ensure healthy growth. Water bears essential nutrients which are pivotal in the mint growth process. Aside from that, water supplies oxygen to the soil, which combines with other critical nutrients to complement the growth process. When water is amiss, the mint growth process is negatively affected. One of the immediate effects of inadequate water supply is mint leaves turning white or yellow. If you are wondering what causes mint leaves to turn yellow, then a poor water supply is the prime reason. 

### 4.   Overwatering 

Why do mint leaves turn yellow? Indeed, overwatering is one of the core reasons why mint leaves turn yellow. If you realize that the issue of mint leaves turning yellow is fast affecting your farm, consider regulating the amount of water used. In most cases, reviving yellow mint leaves requires a simple understanding of the amount of water needed. Too much water leads to root rot, hence causing bottom mint leaves turning yellow. With time, the budding leaves also turn yellow, eventually affecting the entire plant. Notably, most mint plants affected by overwatering are those placed in pots. In such a setting, regulating the amount of water the system absorbs becomes challenging. Therefore, the likelihood of mint leaves turning white or yellow will be higher, depending on the overall response of the plant. 

### 5.   Powdery Mildew 

Have you noticed mint herbs turning yellow? If this is the case, then powdery mildew could be the case. Usually, this occurs when some powder formation affects the lower surface of the mint leaves. Notably, the appearance of the said powder is typically gradual, meaning it might take longer to notice changes on the leaf surfaces. Experts recommend flipping the mint leaves to check the lower surface to confirm if mildew has formed. 

### 6.   Why Does Mint Turn Yellow- Weeds

There is also a high likelihood that leaves turning yellow on mint results from high competition between the weeds and the mint. Some weeds are highly competitive, which hinders mint's nutrient absorption. Therefore, mint eventually runs out of nutrients in a surrounding where weeds overcrowd it. Based on the delicate nature of mint, experts recommend clearing the surrounding to allow the plant to access the necessary nutrients with maximum ease. 

## Yellowing Mint Leaves Remedies- 5 Proven Tricks 

Any changes in the color of your mint leaves should indicate some underlying issues. If you are facing the challenge of mint leaves turning yellow, then the first thing you should do is identify the possible cause. Identifying the cause of mint leaves turning black, yellow, or white is the beginning of generating the ideal approach to mitigate the issue. Currently, there are various solutions for yellowing mint leaves. The foundational aim is to diagnose yellow mint leaf yellowing and eventually adopt the ideal approach. One thing for sure is that green mint leaves and yellow mint leaves are a comparison that defines a healthy and unhealthy plant. Here are some practical ways to prevent yellowing in mint plants: 

### 1.   Reduce Moisture Exposure 

Once you've identified overwatering as the cause of yellow mint leaves, it is to regulate the amount of moisture or water to which you expose the plants. Excessive moisture exposure is a recipe for root rot, which manifests as a significant defect in mint plant growth. Water the mint plant a maximum of 2 times a day to fix the mint leaves turning yellow problem. When the mint plant is grown in a pot, it would only be necessary to water it when the surrounding soil is no longer wet. It is also important to consider establishing a drainage mechanism that does not leave the mint plants in a flooded setting. Too much water exposure causes the yellowing of mint leaves and can eventually impact the growth process. 

### 2.   Mint Leaves Turning Black- Avoid Excessively Dry Soil

One notable thing is that mint only thrives well in reasonably watered places. Mint's structure enables it to respond positively to moderately moist areas, meaning you should water the soil moderately. You may wonder, why are mint leaves turning yellow or black? If that is the case, quickly check if the water supply is reasonable. Dry soil limits mint plants nutrients' absorption rate. Eventually, mint leaves yellow spots can develop, leading to the death of the plant. In some cases, you might notice mint leaves turning brown and crispy, which projects possible drying of the plant. Therefore, it is essential to avoid exposing mint plants to dry soils. 

### 3.   Grow Mint in Open Space 

Plants thrive well in areas with sunlight. Growing such plants in enclosed and hidden places is one of the causes of mint leaves yellow spots. In this regard, it is vital to ensure photosynthesis happens in a natural setting. You can achieve this by providing mint plants with easy access to sunlight. Note that photosynthesis is responsible for manufacturing food needed for plant survival. Sunlight deficiency directly impacts the leaves. An open space exposed to ample sunlight is necessary at this juncture. 

### 4.   Solutions for Yellowing Mint Leaves- Spray Pesticides 

Mints, like most plants, are prone to insect and bug attacks. Notably, infestation by bugs and pests is a significant cause of mint leaves turning yellow. Aphids are among the core attackers of mint plants. To ensure the plants thrive and avoid mint leaves turning yellow, experts recommend timely pesticide application. 

In this case, ensure you use the correct pesticides and perform the application process procedurally and rightly so.
