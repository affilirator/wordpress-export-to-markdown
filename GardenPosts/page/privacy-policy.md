## Who We Are

Garden Enterprise, We, Us, Site, and Website refers to https://garden.gnmnetworks.com. This privacy policy explains or governs how we collect, keep, or use the information you share with us whenever you visit or use our website.

## Information Gathering

When you leave comments on our website, we gather the data shown, your IP address, and browser type as the user agent string to help with spam detection.

Also, we get information when you disclose it voluntarily, seeking assistance or purchasing any service or product from Garden Enterprise.

## Media

Please refrain from uploading images with embedded location data on our website because other visitors can download it and extract location data and other details. Also, we will treat any information you share with us the way we do text.

## Cookies

Our website may use cookies to gather personally non-identifying information. We gather this information to help us determine the most appropriate content to publish on our website or serve our visitors.

Please note that you can disable cookies on your web browser. However, this may interfere with your ability to access some content on our website.

## Embedded Content from Other Websites

Content on this site may include links or embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Links and embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

Please note that Garden Enterprise is not responsible for your interaction with those websites. Once you click those links to visit their corresponding websites or interact with the embedded content, their providers' privacy policies or terms and conditions will govern you.

## Who We Share Your Data With

We don't disclose your information with anyone unless required to do so by the law. However, we may share general information about our website visitors with our advertising partners.

## How Long We Retain Your Data

Our website may retain any comment and its metadata indefinitely. This enables us to recognize and probably approve any follow-up comments automatically rather than hold them in a moderation queue.

If you register on our site (if possible/necessary), we may store the personal details of your user profile. However, you can see, edit, or delete personal information at any time. Also, our website administrators can see or edit your details.

## Rights Over Your Data

If we have your information, or you have left comments on our site, you can request details about it. We'll gladly tell you the information we hold about you. Also, you can request us to erase your data or edit it. However, this doesn't include any data that we keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
