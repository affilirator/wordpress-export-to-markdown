If you notice leaves curling bird of paradise plant after watering, you may be overwatering it. A typical mistake by gardeners and homeowners is to over-water this plant, leaving the roots in water for an extended period. Consequently, the roots start rotting, and the leaves curl outwards and eventually turn yellow. After some time, the leaves fall off, leading to the death of the plant.

#### Cure

If overwatering is the cause of bird of paradise leaves curling, take the plant out of the pot to inspect its roots. Once you notice root rot, clean them to remove the soil. After that, remove the dead tissue with a sterile tool and use a fungicide to spray the wounds. Finally, plant the bird of paradise in a new pot with proper drainage. Ensure the potting soil is free of pathogens and well-drained. Water the bird of paradise regularly, but when the ground is half-dry.

### 2.   Bird of Paradise Leaves Curling Due to Lighting Issues

Ensure your bird of paradise receives moderate to warm temperatures throughout the year. Additionally, avoid planting the bird of paradise near a heat source or your air conditioner vent.

If you suspect water quality is why your bird of paradise has curled leaves, change the source. For instance, use filtered water on your plant if you have hard water.

Report the bird of paradise only when you notice signs of pot-bound roots. These signs include roots emerging through the drainage holes and others growing on top of the potting soil.
