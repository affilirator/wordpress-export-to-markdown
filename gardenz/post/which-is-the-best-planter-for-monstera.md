However, you require the best pot for Monstera to ensure your houseplant’s stability and proper drainage. This blog post shares practical tips for choosing the best for Monstera deliciosa. 

## Why Use the Best Planter for Monstera? 

Monstera houseplants bring the jungle to your living space. However, this plant requires sufficient space in its pot to grow at its best. Monstera is an evergreen tropical vine typical of the rainforests of South and Central America. Many Monstera plants grow in these humid and warm environments. Monstera plants can grow up to 20 meters or 65 feet tall. Since it’s a hemiepiphyte, Monstera uses aerial roots to climb on trees, reaching dizzying heights. 

However, it may grow a little smaller indoors, although some species, such as Monstera deliciosa, can grow up to 15 feet tall inside the house. Monstera adansonii can also reach up to 13 feet. Unlike other houseplants, Monstera is reasonably a slow grower, producing one or two feet of new growth annually. If you choose the best planter for Monstera, your plant will require repotting every two to three years. 

If your Monstera pot is too small, it will restrict or stunt your plant’s growth. Also, if the Monstera planter is too large, it won’t support your plant sufficiently. Additionally, a big pot increases the risk of waterlogging the soil. 

## What Size Pot Should I Put My Monstera In? 

The best planter for Monstera is approximately 2 inches bigger than its root ball. That Monstera planter size provides adequate space for root growth for two to three years. At this juncture, you’re likely to ask, what is the best pot for repotting Monstera? 

When repotting Monstera, move up each pot at a time. For instance, if your Monstera grew in an 8-inch planter, move it up to a 10-inch pot. 

## Signs That You Need the Best Planter Pot for Monstera 

The primary question most people ask is, how do I know I need to get the best planter for Monstera? If your Monstera pot is too small, the plant becomes rootbound, leading to signs of underwatered plant and stunted growth. Here are the top signs that you need the best pot size for Monstera deliciosa. 

- Droopy Monstera leaves 

- Monstera falling over the side 

- Stunted growth 

- Roofs emerging at the bottom of the planter 

- Quickly drying soil 

Please repot Monstera plants to larger pots to ensure their proper growth and development. Upon maturing and reaching the optimal size, you can stop repotting them to prevent further growth. When you stop repotting the plant, you make it rootbound, but this affects its overall health. But you can retain its health by pruning the excess roots. 

If you notice signs of underwatering or overwatering, check the pot size to determine whether repotting is necessary. Nevertheless, always ensure you get the best pots for Monstera plants. 

## How to Choose the Best Planter for a Monstera Plant 

A good planter for Monstera should be aesthetically pleasing and functional. Also, it should provide appropriate growing conditions by enhancing stability, facilitating drainage, giving room for root growth, and holding adequate soil. Here’s how to choose the best Monstera planter. 

### Size 

One of the considerations for choosing the best pot for indoor Monstera is the size. Choose your Monstera pot depending on the size or age of your plant. For instance, visit your local store to buy the best pot for big Monstera plants when repotting a large plant. Also, you can find the best pot for baby Monstera plants by visiting a reputable gardening or home improvement store. 

To choose the right planter size for Monstera, ensure the pot leaves an inch of space on every root ball side and two inches between the roots and the planter’s bottom. 

### Drainage 

Drainage is a critical feature of a Monstera planter. Monstera doesn’t like constantly damp soil or wet feet, unlike other indoor plants. If the Monstera pot lacks proper drainage holes, water builds up at the bottom, keeping its roots moist. Eventually, your Monstera will develop root rot. Therefore, buy a Monstera planter with drainage holes.

### Material 

Monstera pot’s material is as crucial as drainage. It affects the plant’s watering schedule, root aeration, stability, and overall health. Among the popular choices for the Monstera planter material include glazed ceramic, plastic, and terracotta. So, what type of pot is best for Monstera? Let’s analyze each Monstera planter material in detail. 

#### Glazed Ceramic Pot for Monstera 

The glazed ceramic planter for Monstera ensures tall plants’ stability while insulating the roots. Also, it prevents the planter from wicking excess moisture from the growing medium or soil. Additionally, you can get ceramic planters in spectacular designs, colors, and shapes.  

However, some think ceramic is not the best planter for Monstera because it lacks proper aeration level. It requires the best potting mix, and it’s expensive. Moreover, Monstera ceramic pots lack drainage holes. Thus, it is necessary to plant Monstera in a nursery before potting it into a ceramic planter. Alternatively, use a drill to make drainage holes at the pot’s bottom. 

#### Plastic Pot for Monstera 

A plastic planter for Monstera is also a popular choice. It’s lightweight, versatile, and cheap. Also, it won’t break if you drop it, and it will help you preserve soil moisture. However, you must keep your planter stable if you grow a top-heavy, tall Monstera. Also, it has insulation limitations and becomes brittle due to extensive sun exposure. Moreover, plastic is non-porous, meaning your Monstera will be vulnerable to root rot if you overwater the plant. 

#### Terracotta Pot for Monstera 

Unglazed terracotta planters are affordable and beautiful. Also, they are 100% recyclable, making them more eco-friendly. Additionally, Monstera terracotta planters insulate the roots better, aerate the soil, and stabilize mature plants because of the material’s heavy weight. 

However, terracotta’s porous nature can be a curse and a blessing for Monstera. For instance, terracotta pots wick excessive soil moisture, leaving the plant underwatered or thirsty. Also, it can absorb minerals and salts from the water, developing unsightly white stains. Sometimes, this material can provide ideal conditions for mold growth. Moreover, a terracotta planter will undoubtedly break if you drop it or it falls off the shelf. 

### Temperature 

Temperature is a crucial consideration when choosing the best planter for Monstera. Temperature affects your plant’s water requirements. For example, keeping the plant in a room with low humidity or warm temperature will exacerbate drying, necessitating quick and frequent watering. 

If humidity is too high, the plant will require less watering since it will absorb moisture from the air. If the room has a low temperature, the soil will take time to dry, meaning your plant won’t require frequent watering.   

Therefore, choosing the best planter for Monstera requires considering the temperature to decide between porous and non-porous pots. Either way, use well-draining [potting soil](https://garden.gnmnetworks.com/how-to-store-potting-soil/) and a Monstera planter with a drainage hole. 

Unglazed terracotta planters are ideal for humid environments because they dry out faster. Consider a glazed terracotta and plastic pot for the best planter for Monstera to keep in a dry environment. These materials hold more moisture. For hot climates, choose a Monstera planter that can hold water to prevent the plant’s dehydration. Glazed terracotta and plastic pots are ideal options. Unglazed terracotta suits a cold climate because your Monstera will need more water, increasing the possibility of overwatering. 

### Watering Habits 

The current market has porous and non-porous pots to cater to the needs of people with different watering habits. Since you need a planter for a tropical plant, choose one that can withstand frequent watering. However, ensure the pot won’t retain excess water to avoid root rot. 

Porous planters are ideal if you want to avoid overwatering your plant. They have tiny holes that let water and air out. Thus, your grow medium won’t retain excess moisture. Some of these pots include terracotta, clay, and concrete planters. They are available in different shapes and colors, making finding one that complements or matches your décor easier. 

Non-porous pots do not allow water and air to pass through because of their waterproof material. Some of the non-porous planters include ceramic, stone, and fiberglass pots. Non-porous Monstera planters are great for people who may forget to water their plants since they retain moisture. 

### Appearance

The appearance of your planter won’t affect your Monstera plant’s growth. However, the best planter for Monstera will complement your indoor space’s beauty. Monstera is a beautiful house plant, and the pot will influence your room’s appearance. Therefore, look for a Monstera pot that matches or complements your home décor.
