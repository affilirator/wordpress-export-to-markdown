You should water the plants until it flows out of the drainage holes if the soil is dry. However, moderate watering ensures the plants stay moist and not wet. Remember, too much water can harm your plants, encouraging root rot. A pot saucer or tray can help you reduce the risks of water logging by trapping excess water. 

Using soil and coir mixture can also help retain moisture to keep your plants healthy. A coir mixture will make the soil less compact than traditional soil, hence, better moisture retention. Use a moisture meter to test the plants and water appropriately. 

### Temperature and Placement of Tomato Plants Indoors 

Another thing to consider when learning how to grow tomatoes indoors with lights is temperature requirement. Tomatoes usually thrive in warmer temperatures that may not be available indoors.

Gently shake the plants daily to mimic the wind movements when they bloom. You can also facilitate pollination by gently uplifting pollen from mature flowers and brushing them onto young plants with a soft brush or cotton bud. Oscillating fans can also deliver the same results by creating a gentle artificial breeze to stimulate pollination. 

Technological advancements have seen the introduction of various artificial pollination products, such as the [Be the Bee Pollinators](https://www.amazon.com/AeroGarden-Be-the-Bee-Pollinator/dp/B01D5G88ZE) that you can also use.

The containers you use to transplant the seedlings should also have proper drainage holes at the bottom to prevent waterlogging. Although the soil from the old containers may still contain nutrients, filling the new containers with fresh potting mix is also advisable. 

Tomatoes usually require support as they grow to handle the additional weight from bushy leaves and fruits. Sturdy supports such as tomato stakes and cages can be effective in that role. However, the cage's top should remain open when using grow lights for tomatoes to ensure better access to light. You can also use strings and wires for support if you are growing vine tomato varieties. Ensuring proper support is essential and you should master it when learning how to grow tomatoes indoors with lights.
