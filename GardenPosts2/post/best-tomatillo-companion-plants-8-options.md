A good companion plant for tomatillo should grow and thrive nicely in well-drained. Since tomatillos are prone to bests, an ideal companion plant should help keep some of them away. Here's a list of what to plant near tomatillos. 

### 1\. Peas 

Peas are nitrogen-fixing legumes and some of the best tomatillo companion plants. That's because they are ideal companions for heavy-feeding crops like tomatillos. Some sugar snap peas can vine through a tomatillos trellis. However, the pea varieties with a bush habit make the best tomatillo companion plants because they remain small and are low-growing and compact. Also, peas form a symbiosis in the soil. Therefore, they make nitrogen more available to tomatillos. Additionally, their flowers attract pollinators like bees that love the smell of their nectar. And crisp pods produce a great snack while weeding the tomatillo patch. 

### 2\. Borage 

Borage helps prevent tomato hornworms and other caterpillars. Vibrant flowers on borage attract pollinators, and you can use the leaves to improve the soil or add to your compost. Some people plant borage with tomatillos as it is deer proof. But borage plants can be pretty big. Therefore, plant borage on the end of your tomatillo rows rather than in between them. 

### 3\. Onions 

Most people know onions for their pungent aroma that helps keep many pests away. Onions are low-growing, shallow-rooted, and easy to tuck while intercropping with tomatillos. Additionally, onions scare away insects, mites, and ants in the garden. And this makes onions some of the best tomatillo companion plants.

### 4\. Yarrow 

Yarrow is a lovely white flower with numerous benefits when intercropped with tomatillos. This plant has medicinal and ornamental blossoms with a beautiful honey-like aroma that encapsulates their creamy white umbel blossoms and frilly fern-like leaves. Yarrow attracts pollinators while adding a splash of beauty to a garden. Moreover, yarrow can grow quite tall and wide under the right conditions. Hence, it's best to plant it toward the margins of your tomatillo beds to avoid shading the main crop. 

### 5\. Basil 

Basil is also among the best tomatillo companion plants due to its aroma that repels some pests. For instance, its sweet aroma can keep hornworms away. Also, basil is low-growing. Hence, it can help you maximize your garden usage. When intercropping basil with tomatillo, plant them directly or transplant baby basil along the trellised areas. Nevertheless, give your tomatillos 8-12" space from the basil. 

### 6\. Garlic 

Garlic is another plant with a strong smell that makes it stand out among the best tomatillo companion plants. Garlic's strong smell keeps aphids away from a tomatillo garden. You could plant one raw garlic bulb close to the tomatillos to fend off sap-sucking pests. Like onions, garlic is shallow-rooted with a thin stalk. Therefore, it won't interfere with the tomatillo's root zone or access to the sun. 

### 7\. Marigolds 

Marigolds are gorgeous and the best option for a good tomatillo companion plant. This plant gets along with most vegetables in a garden. In addition to repelling mosquitoes and beetles, marigolds attract pollinators. However, this plant also attracts flies and parasitic wasps, which will hang near your tomatillos, ready to eliminate the annoying aphids. Moreover, marigolds add a pop of color to a garden. 

### 8\. Asparagus

Asparagus is also among the best tomatillo companion plants. It's among the best perennial vegetables to grow in your garden. However, establishing asparagus beds can be challenging.
