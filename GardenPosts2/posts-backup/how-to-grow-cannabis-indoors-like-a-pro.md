Knowing how to grow cannabis indoors without soil is impressive. This option can lead to bigger yields and faster growth. The only difference between growing cannabis indoors using outdoor soil and going soil-less is that you provide essential nutrients from scratch. Some soilless cannabis grow mediums include vermiculite, coco coir, and perlite.

#### Hydroponics

You can also set up an indoor hydroponic system for growing marijuana indoors. The primary benefits of growing cannabis indoors with hydroponics include fast growth, better weed potency, and terrific yields.

Ensure your indoor cannabis receives a comfortable temperature, between 70- and 85-degrees Fahrenheit, with beginner lights for indoor cannabis growing. If the lights are off, keep the temperature between 58- and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. However, this may vary depending on the cannabis strain.

For instance, the Indica strain requires a cool temperature. On the other hand, Sativa prefers warmer conditions. Also, you may vary temperatures depending on the development stages. For instance, indoor marijuana may require temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the cloning or seeding phase and 70% relative humidity.

During vegetation, cannabis needs 70-85 degrees Fahrenheit and relative humidity ranging from 40 to 60%. Your indoor weed will require a temperature ranging from 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 40 to 50% relative humidity during flowering.

You can control indoor cannabis grow room temperature by manipulating airflow, lights, heaters, and air conditioners. Also, use dehumidifiers while controlling airflow to manage humidity. Remember, humidity and temperature relate closely. Thus, changing one of them affects the other. Perhaps, that's why this is a vital tip on how to grow cannabis indoors.

### 6.    Train Your Cannabis Plants

Another tip you may miss in most guides on how to grow cannabis indoors is about training the plant. You can use Sea of Green (SoG) or Screen of Green techniques to train indoor cannabis and maximize yields.

The Sea of Green technique keeps the mother plant vegetative while taking the cuttings from it for propagation. You may put the cuttings straight into the 12-light/12-dark flowing cycle to shorten the growing times while increasing the possible annual growth. Sea of Green is the best technique for short, squat cannabis plants or creating a dense growth space.

The screen of Green entails using a wire grid to weave the plant's branches via a mesh. It lets you redirect individual plant branches lengthwise to achieve a horizontal, flat canopy. It's suitable for large cannabis plants that can outgrow the room or where you want the plants to have a similar size.

Learning SOG and SCROG techniques should be part of learning how to grow cannabis indoors for beginners. It will help you determine how to train indoor cannabis to achieve maximum yields. Also, this knowledge will save you the trouble of hiring somebody.

### 7.    Monitor Indoor Cannabis During Flowering

Flowering is a vital phase when growing organic cannabis indoors. It's crucial to learn know the characteristics of this plant during flowering when learning how to grow cannabis indoors. The female plants develop heavy-scented buds since they focus more energy on bud formation. The buds will get larger as resin glands, hairs, and trichomes mature. At this point, switch to 12 dark hours and 12 light hours. This is a crucial tip on how to grow cannabis indoors because light affects marijuana yields.

Also, quit training your cannabis plant and supplying more nutrients as the flowering stage nears the end. However, continue watering the herb. The flowering phase ends between 6 and 14 weeks, depending on the cannabis strain. Sativa finishes flowering from the 10th to the 14th week while auto-flowering and Indica cannabis strains take between the 6th and 9th week.

You can look at your plant's glandular hairs or trichomes to decide when to finish flowering. That way, you can know when the plant has formed the terpenes and cannabinoids fully. Usually, trichomes change from clear to cloudy and then amber. Mastering these changes is vital when learning how to grow cannabis indoors because it helps you determine the ideal harvesting time.

Most cannabis growers harvest their indoor plants when most trichomes get an even mixture of cloudy and amber. Your experience may be uncomfortable if you gather too early when the trichomes are cloudy. On the other hand, harvesting when most trichomes turn amber can provide a less overwhelming and more relaxed experience.

### 8.    Harvest and Cure Your Indoor Cannabis

Harvesting is last step in our guide on how to grow cannabis indoors, and it is relatively easy. Cut the plant's main stem and hang it to dry. The last step involves trimming and curing the harvest, taking up to 5 weeks.
