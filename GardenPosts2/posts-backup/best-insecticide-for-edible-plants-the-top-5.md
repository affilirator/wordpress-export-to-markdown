Always be keen on the types of active ingredients in the insecticides. Organic pesticides contain natural ingredients, while chemical insecticides contain synthetic ingredients. Organic pesticides come from natural sources, unlike inorganic ones. For these reasons, organic products are the best insecticide garden owners should purchase.

### Method of Application

Regarding the application method, gardeners apply insecticides as a liquid spray, powder, or granule. Liquid insecticide spray comes in concentrated form. Usually, you will add water before using it. Also, you will need a sprayer and some protective clothing, including a covering for your face.

A significant disadvantage of liquid spray insecticides is that you may not control where the chemical lands. Wind can blow the liquid spray away when spraying. That way, the risk of wastage can be high, especially when there is a strong wind. Moreover, the insecticide can harm humans and pets when they inhale it.

You can also apply the best insecticide for edible plants as powder or dust. Unlike a liquid spray, dust insecticide comes in a shaker, and gardeners use it in the nooks and crannies of plants. Applying insecticide in powder form is best for shorter or smaller plants. If your plants are taller, this may not be the best insecticide for your garden. Thus, you can opt for the liquid spray.

Finally, you can pick insecticides that gardeners apply as granules. The granules are larger than powder or dust particles. Often, granule insecticides are ideal for fighting fleas, crickets, and ants. You will apply the insecticide granules directly on the specific area you want, making it better targeting than the liquid spray.
