## Choosing the Best Planter for Fiddle Leaf Fig

Fiddle-leaf fig trees generally thrive in tight containers with plenty of drainage holes. It is usually advisable to repot fiddle leaf fig trees every two to three years. Unlike most plants, fiddle leaf fig trees can adapt to planters of different materials and shapes. However, containers without proper drainage can serve as a cachepot or planter stand for fiddle leaf fig.

Unlike plants that grow in the wild, growing indoors requires you to provide almost similar conditions to the natural environment. Thus, there are a few factors that you should look into when choosing the best planter for fiddle leaf fig tree.

### Drainage holes

Overwatering is one of the greatest threats to fiddle leaf fig trees' health, so the best planter for fiddle leaf fig has suitable drainage holes. Please choose a planter pot with drainage for fiddle leaf fig to ensure that your plants do not suffer the impacts of overwatering.

A growing pot with proper drainage holes will let the soil drain quickly and dry out between watering cycles, preventing root rot. The holes allow the excess water to escape, so the plant will only absorb the amount it needs to thrive. The best planter for fiddle leaf fig should have at least one drainage hole, but two or three holes are better. The holes should measure about 2-3 inches in diameter.

### Size

The size of the container is also important because sometimes, using a large planter for fiddle leaf fig tree can lead to overwatering. Large containers hold too much soil that could take much longer to dry out. The golden rule is maintaining a proper ratio of roots to the ground, allowing plants to get enough water and dry out before the next cycle.

If the plant has outgrown the current pot and needs repotting, the best planter for fiddle leaf fig must have a bigger size of about 2 – 4 inches in diameter. Alternatively, you should select a growing container similar to its current size if you are repotting a plant with plenty of room in its original container.

### Shape

Although shape does not necessarily determine the best planter for fiddle leaf fig, you may still want to consider how it complements your plant's needs, the décor elements in your home, and other preferences. Nonetheless, you should consider a pot whose dimensions will hold the fiddle leaf soil mix you intend to use and is adaptable to the plants' roots. The shape and depth of your chosen pot should comfortably fit the plant's root ball.

### Material

The [fiddle leaf fig trees for sale](https://www.amazon.com/fiddle-leaf-fig-tree/s?k=fiddle+leaf+fig+tree) in nurseries usually come in plastic pots. While a plastic nursery pot is cheap and lightweight, it could be a more decorative planter for fiddle leaf fig. Thus, having a more durable and attractive planter as your fiddle leaf fig's long-term home would be best. Terracotta is one of the most popular materials that delivers a long-lasting and beautiful indoor plant pot for fiddle leaf fig.

Terracotta has timeless looks that age gracefully and blends in with different types of décor. Besides, its porous clay absorbs moisture from the soil and promotes air circulation around the roots, ensuring optimal growing conditions for fiddle leaf fig plants. The only setback to terracotta planters is that larger pots can be weighty. These attributes make terracotta worth considering when looking for the best planter for fiddle leaf fig.

A glazed ceramic planter for fiddle leaf fig can also deliver outstanding aesthetics, but larger pots are usually heavy and pricey. Some ceramic planters have drainage holes, but others do not, so be very careful when choosing them.

### Cachepots

Sometimes, you may find the best planter for fiddle leaf fig that perfectly matches your décor only to realize that it does not have drainage holes. Well, that is not uncommon and happens from time to time. The first option in tackling such a situation is to drill holes in the container for proper drainage. However, use a drill that works for the material of the pot. To avoid drilling holes in the container, consider using it as a planter stand or cachepot.

A cache pot is a decorative pot that conceals the functional but less-attractive container inside it. Cachepots do not usually have drainage holes since they only hold the container with the plant. They come in various materials, including metal, wood, and unglazed ceramic. A cachepot enables you to change the appeal of your fiddle leaf fig without repotting it. And this attribute makes it the best planter for fiddle leaf fig for some gardeners.

Baskets usually make incredible cache pots for fiddle leaf fig trees due to their unique styles. Apart from their striking appeal, they come in various shapes, patterns, and colors to match different interior styles. Besides, they are relatively cheaper than larger containers.

### Other Features of Planters

Apart from the draining holes, size, material, and shape, there are other features of planters that you may also want to look into when choosing containers for your fiddle leaf fig trees. For example, a self-watering planter for fiddle leaf fig has a water reservoir at the bottom that allows the plant to absorb water at its own pace.

It also shows you whenever the plant needs watering as you can quickly check the water level in the reservoir. Do fiddle leaf figs like self-watering pots? Unlike other growing pots, a self-watering planter enables your plant to get just the right amount of water without any guesswork. Thus, it is an option worth considering for your fiddle leaf figs.

Fabric aeration pots are also different from standard planters. Also known as Smart pot fabric pots, the containers improve the root structure of your plants by allowing the maximum flow of oxygen to the root ball. Studies show plants that grow in fabric pots tend to create intensely branched rooting structures.
