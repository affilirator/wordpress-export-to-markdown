A raised bed garden provides a convenient way to grow vegetables at home. Compared to in-ground gardening that requires more space, a raised bed garden is an alternative for homeowners with limited gardening space, and rocky or poor soil. Also, it’s ideal for people with physical limitations and inappropriate soil drainage.

## Introduction

Raised bed gardens allow homeowners to grow vegetables at home regardless of their gardening experience or family size. The raised bed gardening idea has existed for centuries. Gardeners and farmers have grown plants on mounded soil for centuries. Most raised garden bed ideas revolve around raising the soil level to six inches or waist-high.

Also, gardeners enclose the gardens to ensure the soil doesn’t spill out. The enclosed soil forms planting beds measuring 3–4 feet wide. The size of the enclosed beds makes them ideal for a single person to maintain without disturbing or stepping onto the planting area.

## What is a Raised Bed Garden? 

A raised bed garden is a form of garden where the gardener raises the soul above the ground and encloses it in some way. Gardeners use word, concrete, rock, and other materials to create raised garden bed structures. Generally, the planting bed sits atop the existing soil, and the height can be a few inches, waist-high, or even higher.

Usually, gardeners leave room around the outside of the bed to facilitate walking around without stepping on the raised bed. This prevents compacting the soil so that it stays fluffy and loose to facilitate root growth due to the free movement of water and air.

Raised bed gardens can have frames, made of sturdy plastic, cinder blocks, stones, bricks, broken concrete pieces, patio pavers, straw bales, corrugated metal, or wood. Gardeners create raised garden beds using materials that suit their landscapes and styles, whether reclaimed or purchased. Overall, building a raised garden bed is straightforward since they are also available in kits. Some garden centers sell raised garden bed kits that allow customization. Thus, you can one that’s easy to assemble and plant your favorite vegetables or herbs.

## How to Build a Raised Garden Bed

Building a raised garden bed is like constructing a sandbox. Hence, you may consider buying a raised garden kit if you lack DIY skills.

### Tools

- Screwdriver, driver/drill, and bits.

- Tape measure or hand saw if you cut planks instead of buying from a lumber store.

### Materials

- For 2”x10”, 2”x8”, or 2”x6” lumber, get 3, 8-foot-long pieces for a 4x8 foot bed. 2 lumber pieces are ideal for a 4x4 bed.

- You may ask the lumberyard attendants to cut your pieces in half if you do not have a saw at home. When making a 4x8 foot raised bed, cut one piece in half to get two pieces for the end measuring 4 feet long.

- Exterior/deck screws

- Use a 4x4 or 2x4 piece in the corners to get something stable to screw into instead of the board’s end grain.

### How to Make Raised Garden Bed Sides

- Mark the half point of the two 8-foot-long boards if the lumber store attendants didn’t cut them. Cut the planks in half if you want to make a 4ftx 4ft bed. That means you’ll get four planks.

- Use decking screws to screw your planks together. Two holes at each plank’s end are enough. Use a drill bit to drill pilot holes, ensuring it’s slightly thinner than your screws. Ensure the plants overlap each other at the end, then screw directly, positioning the pilot holes correspondingly. You may need somebody to hold the plants while fastening the corners.

- Cut the pine stake into four pieces for nailing the boards at the corner for bracing to create sturdier frames.

### Assembling the Raised Bed 

Once you’ve cut the wood and drilled the holes, you can start putting the raised bed together. Here are the steps to follow:

- Lay the beds down: You should lay out the walls to ensure the planks overlap with the pilot holes at the overlapping ends.

- Use long screws to screw the walls and secure every wall to the next. Please ensure you get a snug, close fit.

### How to Fill a Raised Garden Bed

- Please fill the bed with a nutrient-rich compost mix. You can use a commercially produced or homemade mix.

- If you use a compost mix, apply an enriched topsoil, suitable for vegetable gardening. It must have a fine texture to facilitate immediate planting or sowing.

- Fill the bed to the top, bearing in mind that soil will eventually settle once you water it. Also, you can top off the soil with compost once it settles.

Your raised bed garden will be ready for plants or seeds once you fill it with a nutrient-rich compost mix.

## What to Put in a Raised Garden Bed

Soil is essential for any garden, and the best ones have more organic matter. Organic matter feeds soil microbes while allowing water and oxygen to reach the roots. Hence, plants thrive in a garden with more organic matter. Here’s what you should put in your raised bed garden:

- 40% topsoil: Potting soil is too fluffy, hence, unsuitable for raised garden beds. Therefore, use topsoil from a local farm supply store or garden center.

- 40% compost: Compost has nutrients that plants need to grow. You can prepare it at home or buy it from a local garden center. Also, you can use aged manure. However, avoid fresh manure.

- 20% aeration: For purposes of aeration, most bagged soil mixes have perlite, rice hulls, or pumice. If not, add something to facilitate drainage, such as lava rock.

You may visit a local landscape company if you want to fill several raised beds for cheaper building soil or compost mixes. Nevertheless, bagged products are ideal when filling up a single or small raised bed.
