The best EC meter for hydroponics ensures that your plants have adequate nutrients to stay strong and healthy. But what is an EC meter for hydroponics? 

Also known as a CF meter or truncheon meter, an EC meter for hydroponics is a cylindrical device with a sensor to measure your nutrient solution's robustness. The cylinder's calibration has scales on the sides, a display screen, and a red light that turns on to allow you to see the readings. 

A hydroponics EC meter lets you determine the total amount of nutrient salts dissolved in the water. However, the device cannot detect the individual nutrient components. Nonetheless, using EC meter hydroponics comes with several benefits. Plants require varying amounts of nutrient solutions to thrive. Regular measurements with the best EC meter for hydroponics allow you to fine-tune your gardening operations and ensure that the solution does not exceed the required levels. 

Almost every EC meter for hydroponics usually includes directions on how to use the device in your garden. However, using it is a basic procedure that every gardener can perform independently. Remove the protective cap and dip the probe tip into the reservoir. Hold it for about two minutes, then take the readings. You will also need a chart of the preferred nutrient concentrations for specific plants to determine the desired levels for your garden. 

The following is a general guide for the desired nutrient concentrations for a hydroponic garden with mixed plants. 

- Lettuces and herbs (0.5-1.5 EC/ 5-15 CF/ 300-1000 ppm)

- Other common vegetable varieties (1.4-2.4 EC/ 14-24 CF/ 980-1680 ppm)

- Tomatoes (2.2-2.8 EC/ 22-28 CF/ 1500-1960 ppm)

DANGER ZONE (Nutrient concentration levels exceeding 3.0 EC/ 30 CF/ 2000 ppm will burn all the plants in your garden)

With the best EC meter and the above information, you can stay many steps ahead of your garden's nutrient solution and keep your plants healthy.
