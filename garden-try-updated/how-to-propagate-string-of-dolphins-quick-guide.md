## How to Propagate String of Dolphins in Water: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you aim to brighten and complement the indoor ambiance of your home, then you should be conversant with growing string of dolphins from cuttings. The string of dolphin propagation process is simple, but you must conduct it professionally to avoid miscalculating. The idea here is to complete the process of propagating string of dolphins indoors procedurally. You can choose the string of dolphins propagation method that resonates with you. Here is how to propagate string of dolphins in water:

### Cutting

Mastering the best way to cut the suitable plant part is essential when learning how to propagate string of dolphins. Experts recommend cutting part of the plant approximately 7 cm. Ensure that the cutting is close to the plant joints. On the same note, ensuring that the scissors you use to cut the plant are clean using the necessary disinfectants is essential. In this case, disinfectants prevent the plant from acquiring external organisms that can derail or affect the growing process after cutting. Locate the nodes and decide on the ideal position to cut the plant. Experts recommend cutting slightly above the node to allow growth continuity after propagation.

### Placement in Water

At this stage, you should fill a glass jar with water. Professional propagators use distilled water to ensure that the process is successful. After filling the glass jar with water, place the string of dolphins cutting into it and allow it to rest for approximately two months. The idea of using distilled water is to mitigate possible infections and contaminants. It is also necessary to note that string of dolphins thrives in areas of adequate light supply, hence the recommendation of a transparent glass jar. Most importantly, a transparent glass jar lets you track the root growth process and establish the right time to transplant the cutting.

When learning how to propagate string of dolphins from leaves, always remember to place the glass jar under indirect sunlight. As much as the plant requires sunlight for photosynthesis, too much direct light can harm growth. Please wait for the cutting to develop some roots before transferring it. It takes about 2-3 months for the roots to grow.

### Transferring the Cutting

Now that the plant has already developed enough roots, the next thing is to transfer it to the soil. And this is a vital step of the guide on how to propagate string of dolphins. Here's how to do it.

- Fill your chosen pot with well-drained soil. Ensure that no pressure is exerted on the earth to ensure adequate aeration and that the plant develops its roots freely. Place the string of dolphins cutting at the center of the soil-filled jar.

- Cover the rooting structure with soil to ensure they are in the proper growth environment.

- Ensure the plant is adequately watered (at least once daily).

Doing so will ensure that the plant develops flawlessly and that it thrives.

## How to Propagate String of Dolphins in Soil: A Step-by-Step Guide

The second method is known as soil propagation of string of dolphins. Like any other case, you should be fully conversant on how to propagate string of dolphins in soil. Here is a simple guide on how to propagate string of dolphins:

### Cutting

The first step in propagating [string dolphins succulent](https://www.amazon.com/Rare-Dolphins-Succulent-Senecio-peregrinus-Easy/dp/B07NXC2K5T) leaves is to ensure precision cutting. Propagators should cut 15-30 centimeters from the main plant. Note that the cutting should be above the root node. While tracing the root node may not be necessary, propagators achieve more success when they cut precisely.

### Drying

After cutting a part of the main plant, the next step is to place the cutting on a dry surface for at least two days. The idea is to ensure the cutting remains unmoved on a dry surface for two days. It is also essential to ensure the plant is placed at room temperature until it develops some callus. Callus development indicates that the plant is ready to be relocated where it can grow roots.

### Put Soil in a Small Pot

Soil placement is essential when learning how to propagate string of dolphins. Putting soil in a small pot is vital when growing string of dolphins from cuttings. The idea is to get a small container, fill it with soil, and ensure a drainage hole. The drainage hole lets out excessive water from the potting mixture to allow for the healthy growth of the plant. Place the cutting at the center of the pot and cover the lower section with soil.

### Allow the Plant to Grow

Upon placing the cutting in the soil, you should leave it to develop roots. Naturally, the cutting takes approximately one month to grow. It is, however, essential to ensure adequate watering. In this case, water is instrumental in providing the nutrients and moisture needed for growth. Ensure moderate watering so that the plant thrives. Essentially, water the plant when the soil dries up. If necessary, you can add some fertilizers to enhance the quality of the ground. You should consult an expert to guide you on the formula used in applying fertilizers. You can quickly embark on a successful process with the correct string of dolphins plant propagation guide. Note that inconsistencies in the propagation process can soon kill the mother plant and derail the growth of the cutting.
