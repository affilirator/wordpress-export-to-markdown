## Best Supplements to Take Daily for Overall Health

Pulling out weeds and digging for 30 minutes can burn around 200 calories. However, this physical activity can strengthen your joints and bones. That’s why a home garden is crucial for people who want to stay physically fit longer. However, gardening can also put pressure on your bones, joints, and the entire body as you stretch and bend continually. Therefore, you need a proper diet and the best supplements for daily health to stay fit and strong.

### Best Supplements for Daily Healthy of Joints and Bones

Caring for your joints and bones is vital as you get older. People start losing bone density from the age of 35. While it’s a normal part of aging, it sometimes leads to osteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures. So, how can you safeguard your joint and bone health?

Getting sufficient magnesium from diet or daily supplements for overall health can help. Magnesium is essential for the strength and structure of the bones. Since it works with calcium, achieving the right balance of both minerals is crucial. Among the foods you can grow in your home garden to get these minerals include beans and nuts.

Several factors can lead to magnesium deficiency, including over-reliance on processed foods, stress, alcohol, aging, and smoking. When choosing the best supplements for daily health to take for overall health, go for carbonate and hydroxide acetate forms of magnesium. Your body will absorb magnesium in these forms better. Experts recommend a daily dose of 400mg/day.

The body needs silica and MSM to protect the joints. MSM is a sulfur that occurs naturally. To boost your intake of MSM, grow and gather vegetables and [fresh fruits](https://gardenterprise.com/why-do-apples-grow-in-cold-climates-top-reasons/) in your garden. You can also get it from meat. Unrefined foods like rice and cereals are excellent sources of silica. Both are vital in the formation of joint and bone tissues. Taking silica and MSM [daily supplements](http://vitaliboost.sjv.io/q4LO0g) can increase joint mobility and minimize pain.

### Daily Supplements to Boost Energy and Strengthen Muscles

From raking to pushing a wheelbarrow, garden compels your muscles to work extensively. However, working the muscles strengthens them. Also, gardening provides an added benefit since it works various muscle groups. However, this can lead to fatigue and sore muscles. So, how do you supply your body with sufficient energy and protect your muscles from fatigue?

All body muscles require a vitamin-like substance known as coenzyme Q10 to generate energy. Your body can get it from the foods you grow in your garden. While the body produces it from food, its natural level decreases from the mid-twenties. Hence, many people feel weak and tired faster during and after a physical activity like gardening. Nevertheless, you can get it from the best supplements for daily use.

### Daily Supplements for Healthy Skin

Spending time in the sunshine while gardening has numerous benefits. Many people have vitamin D deficiency because they lack adequate exposure to sunlight. Unfortunately, this affects their health negatively since the body needs vitamin D to protect the bones, absorb calcium, and boost the immune system.

However, too much exposure to sunlight can damage your skin. Many skincare products purport to provide the nutrients your skin needs to protect itself from direct sunlight and stay healthy and glowing. Nevertheless, they provide a few nutrients, and your body may not fill the gap from your diet. Hence, you may need daily supplements for healthy skin.

The best supplements for skin have components like omega-3 fatty acids, collagen, vitamin C, vitamin A, biotin or vitamin B7, and probiotics. VB Health has all these supplements as pills, making their use straightforward.

### Daily Supplements for the Gut Health of the Gardener

Gut and digestive problems can hinder you from achieving your gardening role. Hence, it’s normal to ask, what supplements are good for digestive health and the gut? Gardening gets you moving, filling your lungs with healthy, fresh air. Naturally, gardening is meditative and can nourish you figuratively and literally. Research has also shown that getting dirt under your fingernails with microscopic denizens, including bacteria, can boost your gut health.

Naturally, soil has probiotic microorganisms, such as _Mycobacterium vaccae_, which support gut health. This bacterium stays in the soil and facilitates the release of a chemical serotonin that may alleviate depression and anxiety. As a gardener, you inhale such helpful bacteria when digging the soil, when soil enters your skin via a wound, and when you eat vegetables from your garden.

However, these methods may only supply a limited number of healthy bacteria. Hence, you may need daily supplements for gut health. VB Health has quality supplements that gardeners can take daily to achieve and maintain healthy guts. These are some of the most beneficial health supplements a gardener and anybody else can take to avoid gut problems like bloating, heartburn, and irritable bowel syndrome. So, stop asking, what are the best daily supplements for digestion?
