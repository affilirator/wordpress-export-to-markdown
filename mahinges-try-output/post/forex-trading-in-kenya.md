Forex trading is one of the easiest and most profitable ways to make money online in Kenya. However, like any other form of investment, it requires skill and knowledge to be successful. In this article, we will discuss some tips on how to make money through forex trading in Kenya for beginners. 

For those who are new to forex trading, we recommend starting with a demo account. This will allow you to practice trading without risking any real money. Once you have gained some experience and confidence, you can then start trading with real money. 

In order to be successful in forex trading, it is important to learn as much as possible about the markets and use effective strategies. There are many resources available online that can help you do this. It is also important to stay up-to-date with the latest news and events that could affect the markets. 

One of the most important things to remember when trading Forex is to always use stop losses. This will help protect your account from big losses in case the market moves against you.

It is also important to have a good money management strategy, which means not risking more than you can afford to lose. Forex trading can be profitable if done correctly, but it is also possible to lose money if you are not careful. So please do your research before investing any money into Forex trading.

## What's Online Forex Trading in Kenya?

Forex trading is the process of speculating on the movements of currency pairs, and is one of the most popular forms of trading in Kenya. Forex trading can be done through online brokers, and many Kenyans have turned to this form of trading as a way to make extra income. Forex trading is also a great way to diversify your investment portfolio.

When you trade forex, you are essentially betting on the movement of one currency against another. For example, if you think that the Kenyan Shilling will appreciate against the US Dollar, you would buy USD/KES. If your prediction turns out to be correct, you will make a profit. However, if the Kenyan Shilling depreciates against the US Dollar, you will make a loss.

Forex trading is a risky business, and it is important to approach it with caution. It is always advisable to start small and gradually increase your investment as you gain more experience. There are many online resources that can help you learn about forex trading, and it is also a good idea to seek out the advice of experienced traders. Forex trading can be a profitable venture, but it is important to remember that there is always risk involved. Do your research and make informed decisions before you start trading Forex.

If you're a beginner in online forex trading, it might take you a few weeks or even months to muster and become profitable at it. But no worries. Rome wasn't built in a day. And online forex trading remains one of the [best ways to make quick money in Kenya](/).

### Step 1: Learn the Basics of Online Forex Trading

The first step is the most important and it will take you the most effort.

Luckily for you, the cost of internet in Kenya has become ever so low, and accessibility to information is something you no longer have to worry about. This is unlike when we were personally trying to learn how to trade in 2012. Information was scarce. Internet was a special reserve for the wealthy. But those days are long gone.

Assuming that you have an internet enabled device, here are some of the places where you can learn forex trading in Kenya for free:

#### 1\. Forex Broker Websites

Believe it or not, most forex brokers want you to become a successful trader. They will go out of their way to create very informative online courses that they offer absolutely free of charge.

HotForex is a good example of a forex broker who places great emphasis on forex education. They have a very up-to-date online trading course that you can use to learn everything about online forex trading.

To access the complete forex trading course, all you need to do is create a demo or live account on HotForex.

With HotForex, you do not even have to fund your account to start learning. All you need is either a demo or live trading account. Click here to open a live account at HotForex. Or read this [HotForex Kenya review](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/hotforex-review/) on our sister website, [Kenya Forex Firm](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/).

Apart from the online courses offered by forex brokers, most of them will also organize live trading webinars where you get to learn how to trade forex from some of the most successful forex traders in the world.

Locally, [FxPesa by EGM Securities](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/fxpesa-review/) is doing very informative forex webinars. Make sure to sign up for their newsletter or follow them on social media to get informed when they are holding their next webinars.

We also have to applaud XM Forex for their live trading webinars. And please, don't feel uneasy about signing up with all these forex brokers to enjoy the freebies they have on offer. The online courses and webinars are there for you, their client.

While it is not as information rich as the course offered by HotForex, the babypips online course is best suited for forex beginners in Kenya. So, make sure you check it out.

#### 3\. YouTube Videos

##### Can you learn forex on YouTube?

Yes. YouTube is one of the best and free ways to learn forex trading. In fact, YouTube is solely responsible for creating some of the most successful forex traders in the world. There are a number of very informative YouTube channels including Adam Khoo, Meir Barak, and Rayner Teo.

YouTube has some very informative traders. The only downside is that unless you know exactly what you're looking for, it can get pretty confusing trying to learn from YouTube. One trader will tell you this while another one tells you a completely different thing.

To make learning on YouTube more cohesive, we recommend that you choose two or three successful traders to follow. Some of our recommended

### Step 2: Choose a trading platform and learn it

![Which is the best forex trading platform in Kenya](images/Which-is-the-best-forex-trading-platform-in-Kenya.jpg)

As you're learning how to trade forex, you'll come across a few trading platforms. The most popular ones out there are MT4, MT5, and cTrader.

It'd be foolhardy to try and muster how to use all the different trading platforms. As a beginner, just choose one of them and roll with it.

MT4 and MT5 are the most popular forex trading platforms with forex traders all over the world. But cTrader is making a name for itself as being one of the most versatile trading platform.

The only downside with cTrader is that not many forex brokers support the platform. The only logical choices left for you is either the MT4 or MT5 platforms.

###### So, what are the differences between MT4 and MT5, and why would you choose one over the other?

1. MT4 is primarily designed for tradeable **forex instruments** (currencies and some commodities) whereas MT5 is a state of the art forex trading platform that supports **both forex instruments and non-centralized financial markets including stocks, bonds, and futures**.
2. The MT4 platform only **supports hedging**. In contrast MT5 supports hedging and netting. Netting is a concept in forex trading that combines multiple open orders into one. For instance, if you were to buy 1 lot of EUR/USD and later open another position in the same market, the two positions become one.
3. **MT5 is faster than MT4**. MT4 uses an obsolete 32-bit mono-threaded technology while MT5 uses a 64-bit multi-threaded technology that makes it faster.

Bottomline: MT5 is the best forex trading platform for beginner forex traders.

### Step 3: Open a Forex Trading Account With a Reliable Forex Broker

There's a multitude of forex brokers online, and you'll need to open an account with one in order to start trading.

##### Who's a Forex Broker & Why Do You Need One?

A forex broker is a financial services company that connects traders with the interbank market. The broker provides a platform for retail traders to trade currencies and other commodities.
