### Is FxPesa Legit?

Yes, FxPesa is a legit forex broker. They are licensed and regulated by the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya, which means that they have to follow a strict code of conduct. They offer a wide range of trading products, including Forex, CFDs, and metals. They also offer 24/5 customer support. So far, they have not received any complaints from clients.  
  
Additionally, FxPesa is considered legit because its parent company, Equiti Capital, is a group of forex brokers with many years of experience and who are regulated in multiple top-tier jurisdictions.  
  
But don't confuse FxPesa with PesaFx, which is an impostor and most likely a scam. Additionally, make sure that whenever you're depositing money into your account that you're on the official FxPesa website which is [https://fxpesa.com/home](https://mahinge.com/loves/fxpesa-2/).

The company requires basic information such as name, date of birth, email address, and phone number. You'll also need to provide proof of identity and residency.

## FxPesa Account Types

There are a few different account types that you can choose from when opening an account with FxPesa. Each of these accounts has its own set of benefits and features, so it's important to select the account that will best suit your needs.

1. **Executive Account**: The first FxPesa account type is the Executive Account. This is the most basic account and is perfect for those who are new to Forex trading. It offers low spreads (1.4 pips), no commissions, and enables traders to use leverage up to 1:400. The account has a low minimum deposit of just $5.00.

## FxPesa Minimum Deposit

![Fx pesa reviews](images/fx-pesa-reviews-1-1024x512.jpg)

There are 2 types of FxPesa trading accounts, and the minimum deposit required varies depending on the type of account. For example, the minimum deposit for an Executive account is $5, while the minimum deposit for a Premier account is $100. To find out more information about the different types of accounts and their respective minimum deposits, please visit [FxPesa's website](https://mahinge.com/loves/fxpesa-2/).

When looking for a forex broker, one of the most important factors to consider is the minimum deposit required to open an account. This seems like a fair and straightforward requirement, but it can be deceptive.

When a forex broker advertises that they have a "minimum deposit" of $5, they're not telling the whole story. The minimum deposit is just the amount you need to open an account with the broker. However, in order to be successful in forex trading, a person needs to have a lot of money at their disposal so that they can make trades on margin and reap larger profits.

So, although the minimum deposit at FxPesa lies at $5, we don't recommend you start trading with such a low amount.

## FxPesa Spreads & Fees

FxPesa is a good broker, but their spreads on the Executive account are not ideal. They tend to be on the high side, which can make it difficult to make a profit on your trades.

> The spreads offered by FXPesa are not ideal, especially when compared to some of the other CMA licensed forex brokers.

For example, Pepperstone offers starting spreads as low as 0.6 pips on the EUR/USD pair, while FXPesa starts at 1.4 pips. This can make a big difference in terms of profitability, especially for traders who are looking to scalp or trade frequently. Other forex brokers such as XM Forex and HotForex also have much lower spreads compared to FxPesa.

Of course, FxPesa has many other features that make it attractive to beginner forex traders, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a broker.

On the Premier Account, FxPesa charges a commission of $7 per round turn (buy and sell). The commission is charged on all forex pairs and precious metals.

A round turn is the purchase and sale of the same security or currency pair. For example, if you buy EUR/USD, then sell/close EUR/USD, that would be a round turn.
