1. ### **Publish Content on a Daily Basis**
    

Content is your best tool when it comes to affiliate marketing. Make a point of publishing content on a daily basis.

- Blog posts
- Social media networks updates
- Press Releases
- Articles for article directories

2. ### **Track, Measure and Test**
    

Failing to keep track of your metrics is similar to walking blindfolded in a dark alley. Make sure you have a way of tracking where your prospects and leads are coming from and where they are going after leaving your blog.

Track their activities on your site. What are they clicking on? What is motivating them to click? Tracking, measuring and testing is the best way to mold your affiliate marketing program into an income generating machine.

3. ### **Use the Provided Resources**
    

A lot of affiliate programs will provide you with banners, buttons, different types of text links, promotional videos, forms and all manner of promotional tool. **_Do not ignore any of these materials if you want to succeed as an affiliate marketer._**

The materials have been developed, tested and proven to be viable. That is why your affiliate program makes them available to you.

4. ### **Your Own Promotional Material**
    

I am an affiliate for the Aweber Email Autoresponder and one of the most converting affiliate campaign I have ever ran offered an e-book to everyone who signed up for the $1 Aweber Pilot Test. I have never seen such a high level of conversion to date. I am still running the ad in one of my blogs and enjoying the conversions.

#### _**What am I saying?**_

Don’t stop at the promotional materials that your affiliate program provides. Craft your own promotional material too.

5. ### Aim to Build a Loyal Community
    

Hey, that lead is not a cash machine. She is a person who has genuine needs. She needs to be taken care of, to feel loved and cared for. If you want to achieve the super affiliate status, you cannot afford to treat your leads like cash emitting machines.

Once your leads start trusting you, you begin to see more clickthroughs and conversions. Of course the best way to do this is to offer highly informational content on your blog.
