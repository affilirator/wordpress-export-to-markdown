We just blitzed through the month of March.. [Jobs here and there](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelance writing jobs"). Ventures here and there. And it sometimes becomes hard to realize that time is moving. I almost missed posting this month's monthly income statement.

Anyway, now that we are at it, why don't you let me show you how I was able to make _**Ksh 57,000/=**_ as a side income.

I say _**side-income**_ because I am still employed full-time as a Media and Communications Officer for  a conservationist company based in Rukinga, Kenya. The income I make online is however 'my main income'. It is sometimes double or even triple what I earn from working on my full-time job, which begs the question,

_**"Why are you still employed, Patrick?"**_

Trust me I battle with this question day-in-day-out. Why am I still employed? Should I leave my daytime job to concentrate fully on working from home? I need words of encouragement here. Leave your comment below telling me to take the big leap from employment to self-employment.

> Update: Yay! I finally did it. I quit from my daytime job to start my own online company ([http://bit.ly/MakeMoneyOnline](http://bit.ly/MakeMoneyOnlineKE))

## My Online Income Sources on the Month of March

This income statement reflects only the money that has hit my bank account or my Mpesa account. There is much more that I made on March selling ebooks on Kindle Amazon and selling weight loss pills as an affiliate.

1. **Freelance Writing**\- I can't believe that [freelance writing jobs](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelancers in Kenya") still form the largest part of my online income! More than 70% of my income came from here. I have been working on ebooks for a client based in Norway. I won this job through a bid that I placed in Elance. I also work on product reviews and descriptions for another client in Odesk. We hooked up with the Odesk client through one of my Fiverr Gigs.
2. Web Design\- Yes, [I can be a web designer at times](https://mahinge.com/web-design-branding-services-kenya/ "web design kenya"). I taught myself some html, css, JavaScript, jquery and php when I was still in college but thanks God that stuff no longer counts when it comes to designing websites.  I earned $90 from designing a blog for one of the subscribers in my mailing list.
3. Sale of the Kindle Bestsellers Program\- I launched my Kindle Bestsellers Program towards the end of the month and was able to sell 5 copies. This money was sent directly to my Mpesa line. I sold four copies at 499/= and one copy at 599/=. This program is still on sale and I am offering it at 799/= to everyone who places their order today. After today, the program will be available at the normal selling price of 799/=. Here is a primer of what the Kindle Bestsellers Program does.

Apart from the money stated explicitly in this statement, every other online coin that I made in March came from freelance writing. This is not particularly a good thing because freelance writing is employment, and our goal is to become fully self-reliant. Also, in addition to the income that is reflected on this statement, I have also been able to make more money by selling books on Kindle and more affiliate products from Amazon. The reason why I have not included my earnings from Amazon and Kindle here is because Amazon holds the money earned on the platform for at least 60 days to allow customers to return products if they find them unsatisfactory.

Other earnings I have not included in this statement includes $35 that I have earned from [referring people to a social network platform called Bubblews](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/?referral=529eeb383798e1.06219444 "bubblews"). Bubblews has a minimum payout of $50. I didn't hit this amount last month since I was not active on the platform and only relied on money from the referrals I made.

## Conclusion

I still get surprised at how much money we can make online if we remain truly committed to earning this cash. I personally began working online July 2013, and I will be the first person to admit that I have not even began tapping the bulk of cash that is to be earned online. I get lazy and hire people to work for me. There are so many income streams available online.

This month (April, 2014) I will be building a few niche websites and monetizing them with Amazon affiliate products. This follows the success of a research that I have been doing using my kawaida blogs. I will also be writing more books for Kindle.
