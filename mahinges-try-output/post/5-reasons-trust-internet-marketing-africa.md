You are probably on this page because you have received a text message from someone who works for a company by the name of **Internet Marketing Africa LTD** that purports to operate from the 4th Floor of the Commerce House in Nairobi. You want to get answers and I can understand your thirst for information.

_Is the company genuine? Can you make such huge amounts of [money working online](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelance writing jobs") in a week, as the SMS said? Where did Internet Marketing Africa get your details, especially your phone number?_

While I might not provide answers for all your questions, there is one thing that I know.

Jobs in Kenya are scarce, and not even the most philanthropic and humanitarian NGO in Kenya is inviting people to high-paying jobs from the blues.

In fact, from the very fact that Internet Marketing Africa has resulted to spamming Kenyans with unsolicited SMSes, it snugly fits into companies that are characterized as scams.

In this review article, I will provide you with information that you need in order to make an informed decision.

## What is Internet Marketing Africa?

Internet Marketing Africa is a sister company of [SocialBizConnect Kenya](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/ "SocialbizConnect") (formerly My Fortunes Builder). The company operates from Commerce House, Nairobi. The company is owned by one Kimathi Kamundeh.

A few weeks ago, SocialBizConnect was trying to recruit new members, just like IMA is doing. I wrote about SBC a few weeks ago and received all manner of derogatory comments and abuse for my criticism. You can read the viral post [here](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/).

After my exposure of how the SocialBizConnect Kenya cons the Kenyan youth hit the number one spot in [Google](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG "NASDAQ: GOOG"), members of the pyramid scheme were advised to stop saying they were working for SocialBizConnect Kenya. Instead, they were to recruit members under the name of _**Internet Marketing Africa Limited**_.

## What Does Internet Marketing Africa Do?

If you are going to work for Internet Marketing Africa, you surely need to know what the company does, and here comes the spoiler.

**Internet Marketing Africa does nothing but invite members to training seminars for a _small fee_ of 200/=!**

The invitations are to seminars that teach you how to invite new members, and so the cycle goes. You are paid a small fee of 50 shillings for inviting new members to seminars.

In the process, Kimathi and cahoots pockets a cool 150/= from the members you have invited to their seminars. That will be your main 'online work' in Internet Marketing Africa.

Below are 5 reasons why there is more darkness than light in the operations of Internet Marketing Africa.

## Is Internet Marketing Africa Giving Free Blogs?

>  **{Update- Since I wrote this post, Internet Marketing Africa have upgraded their website. Instead of the free blog announcement that used to greet site visitors, you are now welcomed by a few PLR articles about Network Marketing/Multilevel Marketing (MLM). Note how the website is still basic and lacks information about what the company does. The company is still to update their compensation plan, and for a very simple reason- They do not have one.}**

![Internet marketing africa](images/Internet-marketing-africa.gif)

The first thing that hits you once you navigate to the {::_poorly designed_::::} Internet Marketing Africa website is the promise of a free blog!

Who wouldn't want a free blog at this age when hosting costs an arm and a leg? Don't fall for it. Once you click on that Free Blog Banner, you are greeted by a Hostgator affiliate page.

Kenyans know what a _**free blog**_ means and we know when you want to make a few bucks from unethically tricking your visitors that you are going to give them a free blog only to lead them to an affiliate page.

This is super-wrong. It is malicious, scammicious and suspicious.   If Internet Marketing Africa really wanted to give [online jobs](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/www.kenyanpridespot1.com "online jobs in Kenya") to the Kenyan youth, they wouldn't trick them into affiliate pages. In essence, what Internet Marketing Africa is doing is making money for themselves using the Hostgator affiliate link.

## Internet Marketing Africa on Social Media

You would expect a company whose main focus is the youth to be having so much social media presence since it is in the social media where the youth hang out.

Internet Marketing Africa will however not have any of that. Their best shot at using social media channels to reach out to their fans is is to spam Facebook groups requesting for new and vulnerable members to join.

Their [Youtube](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YouTube "YouTube") Video Channel is a joke that was ordered from [Fiverr](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fiverr "Fiverr.com") and shows white people who are apparently making money through Internet Marketing Africa. {:::_white people:::_}. Sorry, but I thought this was a Kenyan thing.   Social proof is one of the indicators that is used to gauge the trustworthiness of a company.

{Update- Internet Marketing Africa now has a Facebook page! Big news, huh!}

## Internet Marketing Africa and SocialBizConnect are One and the Same Thing

If you are intuitive enough, you will notice that the calls to join [SocialBizConnect Kenya](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/ "SocialBizConnect Review") have been declining by the day. Maybe they have hit saturation point. Or the members are taking a sabbatical, reenergizing and coming back to give you over 8,000/= per week!

I will give you another consideration though.

I exposed SocialBizConnect Kenya as a dangerous scheme that will steal money from Kenyans and go under. The expose went viral. When you Google SBC  or SocialBizConnectKenya, the first page you'll probably come across is my in-depth review of SBC.

That means almost no business for the company.   That's why Kimathi Kamnundh hatched and popularized Internet Marketing Africa to counter the decline of business in SBC.

### There is no Information Available Online About the Internet Marketing Africa

This is one of the most obvious red flags about **Internet Marketing Africa**!

A company about _internet marketing_ that does not have any information available online. Who are you kidding? Not even a website where Kenyans can learn more about the company. Not an about us page. Not a twitter account.

How do these guys then claim that they are doing internet marketing?

Open your eyes Kenya.

You do not need to fall for such crap!

If you ask me, the masterminds behind Internet Marketing Africa are the poorest schemers ever. How can you convince people that you will give them a free blog when your own blog/website lies in shambles?

## Multi-level and Network Marketing are Dead

![internet marketing africa scam 2022](images/internet-marketing-africa-scam-2022.jpg)

Internet Marketing Africa, and by extension SocialBizConnect Kenya are trying to revive a system of making money online that is long dead. There might have been times when network marketing and multilevel marketing were the shiz when it came to making money online.

Guys like [Zig Ziglar](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/www.ziglar.com "Zig Ziglar") and [Brian Tracy](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/briantracy.com) made a killing from [MLMs](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Multi-level_marketing) and [Network Marketing](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/would-you-join-a-multi-level-marketing-company-for-retirement-income) but unfortunately those days are gone.  The internet has wisened people up. The promise of a free blog and other regurgitated PLR ebooks, videos and other junk won't work. If you are looking to make money working from home, Internet Marketing Africa is clearly not the place for you.

## So, What Can You Do to Make Money Online in Kenya?

SocialBizConnect and Internet Marketing Africa are scams. Nothing earth shattering goes on at the 4th Floor of Commerce House in Nairobi.
