Hi guys,

This is the first post that I am doing about my monthly online earnings, and I will tell you why.

During last year's Christmas, I announced to my fiancee that I was intending to quit my job in order to explore the world of making money online. This got me into one of the most fierce arguments I have ever had with my fiancee.

"But you just can't quit your job for this _\[expletive removed\]_!" she kept screaming.

Try as I tried, I could not get her to see that the future of business, employment and making money is on the internet. She could not understand why I would be so reckless as to leave a job that pays me about 20k per month for online money exploits.

I think she had a point. [Making money online in Kenya](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kenyanpridespot.com "making money online in Kenya") is hard, but it is  not entirely impossible. I will give you my reasons for why I think it is difficult to make money online in Kenya. But before I actually get into that, let me outline some of the genuine ways that you can use to make money online in Kenya:

## 1\.   Freelance Jobs

When we think of [freelance jobs in Kenya](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelance jobs in Kenya"), a lot of us think freelance writing. This never ceases to amaze me. Freelance writing is part of the freelance jobs that are available on the internet, but it is not the only job that you can do. There are other online jobs like [web design](https://mahinge.com/web-design-branding-services-kenya/ "web design in Kenya"), data entry and virtual assistance that you can also do and earn as much money.

To get started with freelance writing jobs, you will need to create a freelancer's account in one of the many freelance job websites such as Fiverr, [Elance](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/?rid=2R0Q0 "Elance"), Freelancer and iWriter. Some of these sites will require you to bid for jobs while others will only need you to pick a job, work on it and return it to the client for approval.

Fiverr is a special kind of a freelancing marketplace and it deserves a special mention. Unlike the other freelance job portals where you always need to make the first contact with the client, Fiverr requires that you publish your gigs and wait for clients to 'buy' them. I have written a [special report about creating best-selling fiverr gigs here](https://mahinge.com/how-to-get-best-out-fiverr-gigs/ "fiverr gigs").

## **2\.   Blogging**

Fortunately, I have a free e-course that I sell for 990/=, but which is currently free for all the people who register before the end of this week.

## 3\.   Creating and Selling Infoproducts

Infoproducts are digital commodities that you can easily create and sell online or offline for a profit. Some of the [info products](https://mahinge.com/create-killer-info-products-kenya/ "infoproducts that sell well in Kenya") include ebooks, software, audio files and videos.

At this juncture, you should probably tell me to slap myself hard on the face.  I have been telling myself to write my ebook for months now, and every time I get to do it, I get distracted by an urgent project that needs my attention.

There are many other differentiated ways of earning money online in  Kenya. I will post about all of them in one extra long post and share it with you right here on mahinge.com.

For now, let us get back to the track and look at the reasons why it might be extra hard for you to make money online in Kenya.

To begin with, if you are relying on freelance jobs to make money online, you are in for some stiff competition. All the freelance market places that I know of are [saturated with cheap laborers and low-ballers](https://mahinge.com/have-you-become-a-slave-to-cheap-online-labour/ "freelance jobs").

If you get lucky enough to escape the curse of the low-ballers, there is the [Native Bias Phenomenon](https://mahinge.com/experience-non-native-english-freelance-writers-kenya/ "native english writers bias") waiting to frustrate you.

Here are the other reasons why making money online in Kenya can be an uphill task that only a few dedicated individuals can pull through:

- **Making money online requires time**\- If you do not have this precious commodity, there is no way you will make enough money online. Having enough time will sometime mean that you have to quit your daytime job to concentrate on building an online income empire. Show me a few Kenyans who are ready to quit their daytime jobs to pursue an online income dream, and I will show you the meaning of success.
- **People Don't Send Mpesa to Strangers**\- Kenyans are an untrusting lot, not that there is no good reason for this mistrust. In a world full of conmens and scammers, it pays to be cautious with your wallet. If you think you will just create a product or service and have Kenyans flock to buy it, you are in for a rude shock.

Why did I go to all these pains of sharing all this information with you. To prove that I know what I am doing. There is money to be made online whether you are in Kenya or Kuala Lumpur, but this money does not come easy. You will have to pour in energy, creativeness and time in order to start scathing the surface of making money online.

## So, What Did I make in January

From the moment we had that argument with my girlfriend around Christmas time, throughout the whole month of January and now we are in the 4th of  February, I managed to make $447.87 from my online earnings as a freelance writer. Converting this to Kenya shillings brings it to around 35,800/=.

I made this money mainly from Elance, some from Fiverr and a lot from a client that I privately write e-books for. Here is a screenshot showing my earnings for this period.

If I was a jackass, I would have picked up my phone, dialed my girlfriend and said, "You see Sweethear, I told you it could be done."
