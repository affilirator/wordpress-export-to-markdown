It feels like heavens. No? for real this is more than heavens. Even the fieriest of storms can feel like paradise when you are the one brewing them up against all those haters who don't want you to succeed.<!--more--> But success follows me like a dog would follow a she-dog on heat. That's how tight me and success are. That's the affinity I have towards success.  
[![](images/Cryptic+Writes+Moving.jpg)](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/www.kenyanpridespot.com)You don't believe me but look who's moving, look who's receiving all those pageviews you would only dream about achieving 12k and counting on a blog that is a sub-domain of the main thing, yet I fckuing hit 12k page-views...make that within a span of four months. But I am not here to brag. That is not the reason why I am wearing off my fingertips on the keyboard typing this. I just wanna share the good news or bad news considering that we have different perspectives of the same half-empty-half-full bottle. Anyways, I decided to move. To a better place. Did you think I would move to a less better place. I know some of us would rather I stop blogging and write my stuff on writing pads that would be blown away by the gustily Tsavo winds as soon as I start filing them. Some of you...  
It is easy to register for a domain. I wonder what all those pricks who started blogging before I did are stuck with sub-domains that make your blog sound cheap. Isn't free cheap, people? I ain't dissing. I don't have time for that but I have earned my bragging rights, I have that [blog that reads like me](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/www.kenyanpridespot.com), and that is not even the end of my online exploits. In short what I want to say is that I have moved from here to here
