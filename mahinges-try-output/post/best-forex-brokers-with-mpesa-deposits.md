Our in-house forex traders and account managers have personally been trading with XM Forex for the past 7+ years, way before the broker even started accepting Mpesa.

1. Australia

Among all the licenses, the Australian license carries the heaviest weight. Not many forex brokers are able to obtain trading licenses in top-tier countries like Australia. The fact that XM Forex is licensed in Australia should boost your confidence when choosing to trade with them.

To verify your account, you’ll only need to provide your identification document (National ID or passport). We recommend you use your Kenyan National ID to verify the account. When registering, make sure you provide the details indicated at the back of your ID as the address details.

### 3\. LiteFinance - Best ECN Forex Broker That Accepts Mpesa

![best forex trading platforms in kenya](images/trading-platforms-in-kenya.png)

Formerly known as LiteForex, LiteFinance also makes it in the list of the best forex brokers in Kenya. LiteForex is the other broker that accepts Mpesa and makes the forex trading account opening process a bliss. Not only that, but this Mpesa Forex Broker also offers revolutionary trading features including a copy trading platform that lets you copy trades from the most successful traders on the platform.

Just to show you how innovative LiteForex has been, they were the first forex brokers to pioneer cent accounts, whose minimum deposit is as low as $1.00.

LiteForex boosts over 15 years in the market, having been established in 2015.

#### Why Choose LiteForex in Kenya?

- Forex Copy Trading

[Forex copy trading](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/forex-social-trading/) is one of the most revolutionary forex trading systems of our time. With the copy trading system, you simply deposit money into your LiteForex trading account, choose a successful forex trader to follow/copy, and watch your profits roll in.

The copy trading system works on profit sharing basis. Mostly 70:30 where you get 70% of the profits earned from your capital while the strategy provider gets the other 30%. Considering that all you have to do is deposit money into your trading and watch the professional trader do the bulk of the work, I’d say a 70:30 profit share is something to smile about.

It is almost impossible to blow your account when using forex copy trading if you choose the right strategy provider to follow. Your money is also safe and you can withdraw it at any time as the money is held by the forex broker, not the strategy provider.

If you’re a professional and profitable forex trader, you can also earn extra income from copy trading by sharing your forex trading strategies to be copied. The process is easy and seamless.
