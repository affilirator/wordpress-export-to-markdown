Welcome to [Nairobi](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/kenyaforexfirm2.com), the City in the Sun. The city where the party never ends. If you are looking for a party joint to while away the weekend while you are in Nairobi, here are 5 exceptional party venues that will blow your mind away:

## **#1 XS Millionaires Club**

Located in Baricho Road, XS Millionaires Club is, as the name suggests, a place for those with loads of cash to throw away. Nevertheless, the kind of entertainment you get XS Millionaires is worth every dime you spend. The best feature at the club has to be the seductive poll dancers and model waitresses.

## **#2 Tribeka- Kimathi St.**

The atmosphere at Tribeka attracts old revelers (30-35), who somehow live in the relish of their sweet sixteen years. The atmosphere in the club is cool and the furnishings are funky and welcoming. During my last visit at Tribeka, a bottle of beer was 200/=, which is not a bad price when you are partying in Nairobi.

## **#3 Scratch- Moi Avenue**

If you are looking to be plastered with tots of Amarula and Sabuka at pocket-friendly prices, Scratch is where you want to be. Scratch is a unique late-night club conveniently located in Nairobi’s Central Business District. The club has two main attractions- an elevated dance floor and an outdoor patio. Scratch hosts many popular DJs and celebrated Kenyan and international music performers.

## **#4 Mercury- Waiyaki Way**

This out of town party venue boasts of a cool ambiance, invigorating music and waitresses who dress to kill. The security team is friendly but what I don’t find alluring about Mercury is the fact that most of the clientele are too laid down for my gregarious rave personality.

## **#5 Brew Bistro- Ngong Road**

Brew Bistro combines it all- lively revelers, perfect security personally, good music including live performances by established [Kenyan](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/kenyaforexfirm2.com) artists and karaoke. However, be mindful of how much you spend on their wines and spirits. The price will leave your wallet groaning.
