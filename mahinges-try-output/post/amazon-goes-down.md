If you are an Amazon publisher, you may just be wondering what is happening. The truth is that Amazon has been down for the past five minutes. More information is available [here](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/amazon.com.html "amazon down")  
As of the time of publishing<!--more--> this, no reason had been given as to the reason behind the server going down.  
The customer care desk however has assured me that things will be back to normal in a while.
