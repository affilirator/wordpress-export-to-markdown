Many bloggers in Kenya start blogs very hopeful that they will be making the big bucks after 6 or so months, but many of them don’t even stay past three months. For many of those who do, it takes them close to one year to start getting traffic of 1000 per month.  This is discouraging to any blogger, especially if you know that you have researched the right keywords and followed the right procedure to [create a blog that should be making you money](https://mahinge.com/type-blog-will-make-money/ "what type of blog will make you money").

If the above scenario describes you, have you ever sat down and asked yourself why this maybe so? If you have what are you doing about it?

In this article I will explore five of the most obvious _**reasons why many new blogs fail**_.

## The blog is not making money

This is one of the top most reason why many Kenyan blogs fail. Many people have heard that [you can make millions from blogs](https://mahinge.com/really-make-money-blogging/ "can you really make money blogging"). What do they do next? They rush to open blogs hoping to strike the jackpot within a week.

What most of them fail to understand is that _it may take you up to six months to make your first dollar blogging_. This are not just six months of doing nothing rather they are six months of hard work to make your blog better. My advice is if you are looking to make money from your blog you must really commit to it.

Patience is key here.

> If you want to make a thousand dollars in one week, blogging is not the way to go.

## Not promoting your blog

_How else will your blog get noticed if you do not promote it?_

The best way in which your blog will get noticed is to promote it. You should identify the best way to promote your blog. In many cases [using social media works well](https://mahinge.com/category/social-media-marketing/ "social media").   Am sure if you saw a friend of yours in a social media promote their blog you would be curious to know what they write in it.

Apart from social media marketing, you should also try email marketing on your blog. I personally use and recommend [Aweber](https://mahinge.com/visit/Aweber "Aweber") for all email marketing and promotion. [Click here to try Aweber for 30 days at only $1.00](https://mahinge.com/visit/Aweber "Try Aweber").

Promoting your blog is the first very important way of attracting traffic to your blog.

## Inconsistency

Consistency is important in blogging. Even in business consistency is key to keeping customers. Most [Kenyan bloggers](https://mahinge.com/fully-monetize-blog-kenya/ "kenyan bloggers") start off with a lot of enthusiasm but somewhere along the way somehow the enthusiasm just dies.

Imagine you are a great fan of this blog that posts amazing content frequently then all of a sudden they no longer post. Would you still continue checking it as often as you did?

I bet not.

This is what happens when you are not consistent in posting new stuff on your blog. The [traffic you had started attracting](https://mahinge.com/get-massive-blog-traffic-new-website/ "attracting traffic") reduces and finally you are left with no followers at all.

## Poor writing skills

Starting a blog is very easy.

Today anyone who wants a blog can start one. Most people assume just because they can construct sentences they can write for a blog.

Poor [writing skills](http://www.andikawriters.com "writing skills") results in poor content. Who wants to spend their precious time reading content loaded with errors?

However if you are really interested in running a blog but your writing skills are wanting, you can hire someone to write guest posts for your blog. In the mean time you can learn and improve yours and write your own content eventually.

## Inadequate knowledge in your niche

Most people don’t bother to do a research on the niche they are entering to. For example, you happen to come across information telling you that beauty products are selling like a hot cake online.

What will most people do?

They will run to their computers to [**start a blog**](https://mahinge.com/ "start a blog"). They won’t even do any research on the beauty product. Eventually they find out that they never made a prior plan and the blog is a total failure.

Running a [successful blog](https://mahinge.com/start-successful-blog-brings-money-fame/ "successful blog") is not such an easy thing but it’s not impossible. Just avoid the obvious mistakes and be patient.

Successful bloggers never give up.
