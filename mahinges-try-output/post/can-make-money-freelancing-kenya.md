## Top 5 Websites to Find Freelance Writing Jobs in Kenya

There many websites that allow you to register (either for free or at a fee) and start working online in Kenya. Here are a few of them:

1. ## [Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/elance "Elance")
    

[Elance](https://mahinge.com/visit/Elance "Elance") is by far the most professional freelance marketplace where you can find online writing jobs.

It is free to register and apply for freelance writing jobs with an Elance account.

However, you will be charged 8.5% on every milestone payment you receive from your clients.

Once you have registered for an Elance account, you can begin bidding for writing jobs. If a client likes your bid/application, they hire your for the writing task and deposit money in an Escrow account.

When you complete the task, the client will release the money held in Escrow into your account.

## 2.        [oDesk](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/www.odesk.com "odesk")

oDesk works in a similar way as Elance. In fact, the two companies entered into a merger agreement on December 2013.

Opening an oDesk account is completely free. Once you have opened your account, you will need to start applying for freelance writing jobs.

Clients can hire you on an hourly of fixed price jobs. While working on the hourly jobs, remember to [download the oDesk Team Application](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/downloads) and keep it running for the duration that you will be working. This is the only way to guarantee that you are paid for the hours worked.

The more hours you are able to log on oDesk, the more the higher chances you have of getting hired by clients.

There are two other important things that you need to have in order to increase your chances of getting hired  by clients on oDesk:

- Upload a few portfolio items on your profile
- Do and pass tests that pertain to your chosen field of freelance work.

## 3.                         [Freelancer](https://mahinge.com/visit/freelancer "Freelancer")

Freelancer is one of the oldest marketplaces for freelance writers in Kenya.

Although some freelance writers are able to build strong writing careers on the platform, I personally tend to look down upon the it. It is littered with scammers and low-paying clients.

If you are just starting out, and you would like to test the waters, Freelancer is probably the best place to start.

To ensure that you do not fall prey to the scammers on the platform, never attempt to do a job if a client has not funded milestones.

## 4.          [iWriter](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/iwriter.com "iwriter.com")

[There is so much to be said about iWriter](https://mahinge.com/7-incredible-tips-maintaining-awesome-ratings-iwriter/ "iwriter"), including the fact that it is one of the most awesome places for freelance writers in Kenya to find simple freelance writing jobs without competing with other [native-English writers](https://mahinge.com/experience-non-native-english-freelance-writers-kenya/ "native English writers") and [low-balling Indians](https://mahinge.com/freelance-jobs-kenya-signs-underpaid/ "freelance writing jobs").

Before you behead me for calling it one of the best places for freelance writing jobs, let me be straightforward. [iWriter](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/iwriter1.com "iwriter") has some of the most demeaning rates for professional writers.

The pay however increases as you rise among the ranks. If you can survive the measly pay for a month or so, you will find that soon enough, you are earning top bucks for your talent.

##  5.         Fiverr

I have extensively written about [Fiverr gigs here](https://mahinge.com/how-to-get-best-out-fiverr-gigs/ "fiverr gigs"), and I still believe it is one of the most awesome places to get **freelance writing jobs in Kenya** without all the hassle.

What happens in Fiverr is that you list your services (referred as **gigs**) on the websites. Clients come looking for gigs on the platform, and if your gig catches their attention, they place an order, deposit the cash in your account, and you get to work.

Every freelance writer that I know of has his/her favorites among the many websites, and what works for one writer may not necessarily work out for you. I therefore advise that you try each one of these freelance writing platforms and stick to the one that seems to be working in your favor.

## Becoming an Exceptional Freelance Writer

Here is my own exclusive compilation of the **_ABCD’s of making good money while doing freelance writing jobs in Kenya._**

1. **_A is for Accounts_**\- where you open freelance job seeker accounts matters a lot. Some platforms are so shady and I would advise you to stay clear of them. Odesk and Elance on the other hand have a good reputation, which is a good thing. I am personally big in Elance and I constantly have jobs open for freelance writers in Kenya. If you have not yet done so, head over to [Elance](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/?rid=2R0Q01 "elance in kenya"), open an account, make sure your profile is complete then come back here and use the contact us form to tell me you want a freelance writing job. You can also send me an email at **[patrick@mahinge.com](mailto:patrickm@mahinge.com) with your Elance account details and the type of freelance writing job you want.**
2. **_B is for Believe_**. Trust me, without faith you are bound to fail time and over again. You need to strongly believe that there is money in freelancing for you to get over the many rejections that will be slapped on your face. You need faith to start working with clients, some of whom will insist that they can only pay you at the end of the month. To build up your faith and desire to succeed, I would recommend you read Napoleon Hill’s **_Think and Grow Rich_** ebook.
3. **_C is for Compete_**\- I have seen a lot of freelance writers in Kenya, who because they spend their time locked up in their houses raking in quick money from freelance writing,  believe that the world is all theirs for the taking. They literally stopped learning the moment they got their first freelance writing job. That’s the wrong mentality. You are in an industry that is dominated by more than 100 million people! You need to constantly find **_ways of improving your freelance writing career and taking it to the next step_** in order to remain relevant to the market. This includes marketing yourself to the relevant clients.
4. **_D is for Delimit_**\- if I had somebody to tell me what I am telling you right now, I would have avoided some silly mistakes I committed as I started on path to freelance writing. Get out there with limits on what you can and cannot do, what type of clients you wish to work for, what amounts you can accept and what would sound like an insult. More importantly limit the type of writing jobs you apply for. The idea of limiting yourself to a particular niche sounds scary to many freelance writers, but it does pay off at the end. I personally handle press releases and app reviews and I have made myself an expert in those particular fields.
5. **_E is for Educate and Encourage_**\- you have finally made it to the clime of your career. You have a set of good clients and the jobs and the money are pouring in. don’t lock yourself in. let the world know how hard it was getting to the top. Someone somewhere is in need of your encouragement. Start a blog, start a Facebook Page. Reach out to them and let them know that there is hope at the end of the tunnel.
