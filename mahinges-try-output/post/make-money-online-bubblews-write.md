Hey there,

As I promised, here comes another online money making tip. It is a little social sharing network known as [Bubblews.com](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/?referral=529eeb383798e11.06219444).

## **What is Bubblews.Com**

To put it very lightly, Bubblews is a social media sharing site, which pays you for posting your thoughts and getting them viewed, commented on and liked by other users on the platform. The more your posts are viewed, the higher the money you get to earn.

It is absolutely free to join Bubblews. I have personally been a member of Bubblews since last year November and I am able to make more than $200 on a very good month. You can have a look at [my profile and account here](http://www.bubblews.com/account/105810-ex-girlfriend/?referral=529eeb383798e1.06219444).

I will be sharing with you tips that you can use to make more money from Bubblews in a future tutorial. One thing that you should however keep from doing is oversharing your content on other social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. This can lead to the banning of your account.

## **How Do You Earn Money on Bubblews.Com**

There are several ways in which you earn money from Bubblews.com

1. Posting updates
2. commenting on other people's updates
3. When you content get viewed
4. When your content get liked, and
5. The bubblews business partnership program

## **Is Bubblews.Com a Scam Site**

The jury is actually still out on this. There is widespread debate about whether Bubblews is a scam site. You can read some of the [observations and reviews about it here](https://mahinge.com/visit/Bubblews).

As per my opinion, Bubblews is quite legit if you follow all the rules of the platform. Mostly, if you are oversharing your updates on other media updates, your account will get banned and you will not get paid.

Some users have complained that Bubblews lets you withdraw only the first $50.

However, if you observe all the rules of Bubblews, I am that you will never get banned and you can continue earning an online income from Bubblews. I have been using the platform since November of last year and I can give you my word on this.

## **How Much Money Can You Make From Bubblews**

You can [make as much money as you want](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "freelancers in Kenya") from Bubblews. It depends with the people who are following you and how active you are on the website. The highest I have made from Bubblews in one month was $200. This is despite having not that many followers and only logging into bubblews to comment on other people's status updates for 30 minutes per day only.

## **Do I Need a Website to Register for Bubblews?**

Absolutely not... There is a section that requires you to input your website url as you register, simply ignore this and fill out all the other relevant details.

In fact the only two things you need when [registering for Bubblews](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/?referral=529eeb383798e11.06219444) is a valid email address and a Paypal account.

## **How Much Money Can I Make From Bubblews?**

We all want to know what an opportunity holds for us before we commit ourselves to it fully.

At Bubblews, the amount of money you earn depends on how active you are in the platform. Here are some of the few things that you should try to do on a daily basis

1. Post at least **10 updates everyday** spaced out at least one hour each. This ensures that your posts get maximum visibility. One thing to note, always make sure that you do not post copypasted stuff. This will get you penalized! Also ensure that your content is at least 400 words long.
2. Connect with at least **20 Bubblers per day**
3. **Comment on at least 10 Bubbles** (posts per day)
4. **Share your referral link at least twice** on Social media networks
5. Avoid sharing your own posts more than twice on any social media accounts

If you follow these suggestions with the strictness of the ten commandments, you should be able to earn at least $5 per day, which means that it should take you at least 10 days to get to the **minimum payout of $50**!

## **How and When Will I Get Paid By Bubblews?**

Bubblews has a minimum withdrawal balance of $50. Once you get to this amount, you can withdraw your money through Paypal. The cash takes 3-5 days to get to your Paypal account.

If you are predominantly active in Bubblews, it should take you less than 10 days to hit the $50.00 payment threshold.

## **Are There Any Other Websites Like Bubblews**

I have heard of other sites that operate like Bubblews but I have not tried all of them. Some of the sites I have heard being mentioned include Redgage, Teckler and Squidoo.

I have not used any of these and cannot give you my word on them. The general consensus out there however is that they pay less compared to Bubblews.

Another site that works like Bubblews, but requires more mature content is [Hubpages.Com](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/feed). I have been a member of Hubpages for more than one year now but has never earned a cent from it. The only reason why I still submit my content to Hubpages is the exposure it gives me online.

As we continue to grow together, I will teach you how all these sites work and how you can make a living from them. I also cover this information more deeply in my ebook which shall be available from the 15th of March.
