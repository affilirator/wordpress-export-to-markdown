As a media practitioner and an online freelance writer with tonnes of work to do, and the same amount of invoices to bill and keep track of, I often find myself overwhelmed by the paper work. And carrying all the scripts for my stories isn’t as easy too. Compound this with the dreaded tax returns filing and you have a situation to drive you completely nuts. The mathematics would simply overwhelm me. But it doesn’t, thanks to [Shoeboxed.com](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/click-7020401-10593827)![](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/image-7020401-10593827).

My discovery of Shoeboxed was very accidental, but sticking with this great team has been the best experience and has calmed all my paperwork anxiety.

What I was doing was looking for a secretary to do some of my filings. I took my search to the internet and one thing led to the other. This is how this dedicated team works; you forward them your receipts, business cards, bills and other paper clutter that you need sorted and filed online, they scan them and save them for you in a secure online account, completely sorted and very easy to find

If you have ever used a scanner, then you would very well understand the agony of standing in front of a scanner waiting to scan more than one rim of papers.en the best experience and has calmed all my paperwork anxiety.

The largest beneficiaries of Shoeboxed however, are the majority of us with multiple businesses and the same number of revenue sources. With Shoemaker, you can be sure that when it comes to filing your income tax returns, every single of your receipts will be easy to find and enter. For people with lots of work related expenses this could translate to increased chances of bargaining yourself a hefty tax refund from the IRS.

And by the way, you don’t have to worry about the security of your documents. Shoeboxed uses 256-bit SSL security, which is what most of the US banks use too.

### **Prices and Bundles**

The Shoeboxed pricing and bundles come in three categories, Lite, Classic and Business. I have generally found out that the choice of a package depends with the amount of documents you want them to handle for you. I personally use their Classic bundle. After choosing either one of the above plans, you can choose whether you want per month billing or annual billing. I personally prefer the annual billing as it frees me from the anxiety of having to worry about the bills every month. Shoeboxed also has a trial version which offers all the features of the paid versions and allows you to scan and upload up to 50 of your documents. This is a great way to test Shoeboxed and see if it fits your needs before you make the commitment to pay.
