One of the best and time-tested ways of making money in Kenya is to produce and sell your own info products. E/books, movies, audio files, you name them. Info products that sell well have a very large potential to generate a passive income and allow you to work from the comfort of your home. What I like most about info products is that anyone can create them, no matter the type of business they run, offline or online.

## **5 Easy-to-Create Info Products That Are Highly Marketable in Kenya**

When we talk about infoproducts, a lot of people think about ebooks, which are the common type of info product out there. The range of infoproducts you can create however extend beyond ebooks and online reports. Here is a glimpse at some of the other less explored forms of infoproducts that you can create to make money.

1. **_Voices to Text_**

Some people find that speech comes to them naturally. They can speak more coherently than they can write. Others are super slow in typing, and this hinders the amount of content they can produce typing. If you prefer to dictate your thoughts rather than write them down, you can make use of recording software that automatically translates voices into text. The most popular and affordable voice-text translation software is [Dragon Naturally Speaking](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008MR36FE&linkCode=as2&tag=crypwrit-20 "dragon naturally speaking"). You can also use Google Voice to record and translate your thoughts.

After you have translated your voice into text, all that you will have to do is edit the document to ensure that no misunderstanding with the software occurred.

2. **_Recorded Interviews_**

Did you know that you can sell audio clips of your recorded interviews? Get out there and conduct interviews with experts in your field of interest, you will get a ready-to-sell infoproduct that requires very little additional work on your part.

A lot of people prefer to download audio clips on their [Mp3 players](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=mp3%20players&linkCode=ur2&tag=crypwrit-20&url=search-alias%3Delectronics "Mp3 Players") and listen to them as they work or walk.

You can even outsource for a freelancer to transcribe your audio so that people who prefer to read your interview can also do so. Skype lets you record voices if you cannot make to be in a one-on-one meeting with your interview. There are also a set of audio recorders that will allow you to record your conversation over the phone.

If you can make to have a live meeting with your interviewee, you will need to invest in a professional audio recorder. There are many brands of audio recorders out there, but a lot of people prefer the [Olympus WS-803 Voice Recorder](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006ZW4HA6&linkCode=as2&tag=crypwrit-20 "Olympus").

_3._      **_Create Screencast Tutorials_**

Visual communication is by far the best means of communication. This probably explains why there are millions of videos uploaded on YouTube after every few hours. The good thing about screencasts is you do not have to invest in expensive video recording equipment.

You can easily create a series of tutorials by recording actions on your screen and backing them up with an audio recording. [Camtasia](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009AYOWXI&linkCode=as2&tag=crypwrit-20 "Camtasia") and [Jing](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jing.html "Jing") are by far the best screencast recording software out there.

_4._      **_Slideshow Videos_**

One of the easiest ways to make money from creating infoproducts is to create a slideshow in PowerPoint and then convert it into video format. If you already have PowerPoint installed in your computer, simply pick a beautiful template, add some graphics, screen captures, bullet points and make an informative slideshow.

You can add a recording of yourself on the slideshow giving the tutorial instructions. Additionally, you can include music clips in the background to make the slideshow more compelling.

_5._      **_Outsource for the Infoproduct you want_**

If the above recommendations are so complicated for you, you can always outsource the work to an expert freelancer. [Elance](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/?rid=2R0Q02 "elance") and [Odesk](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/www.odesk.com "odesk") are two freelance websites that are full of able freelance. Another cheaper option where you can get premium quality info products created for you at an all-time low-cost is [Fiverr](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-your-article-in-my-pagerank-4-blog "fiverr").

With so many easy and free ways to create your info products, there is really no reason why you should let your inability to write comprehensive sentences stop you from making money using infoproducts. Even if you are good in writing, it is advisable that you have info products in various formats to increase the chances of you scoring a lead. You also end up owning a lot of killer info products that you use on your [optin-in forms](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/build-web-forms.htm) or for sale in the various online stores in Kenya.
