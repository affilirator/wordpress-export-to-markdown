During my lifetime (I will be 31 in May, yay!) I’ve experienced a lot of successes. (A lot of failures too, but that’s for a different article.) I’ve taught myself how to swim, won district high school biology contests, won darts tournaments. I’ve opened retail businesses, made a profit. I’ve written books, became a respected internet marketer and made thousands of dollars online.

That’s not to brag, but to set the table for what I’m about to say next.

The “success system” I have used for each of these includes the same **seven steps**. Whether I’m wanting to buy a new expensive toy, complete a race, launch a new product or any of a thousand things, I use the same set of steps.

Do you want to achieve success with your online business? Here are the steps:

1. ## Set Your Target
    

![success online work kenya](images/set-your-target-300x300.jpg)It all begins with a goal. It can be a “little goal” (Ex. Lose 5 pounds, make $1,000) or a “big goal” (Ex. Lose 75 pounds, make $100,000). It doesn’t matter. It all begins with a goal. A target. Something to work towards. An end result.

That’s your first step. Decide what it is that you want to accomplish. Write it down. Draw a circle around it. Bullseye. Now let’s talk about how to hit that goal dead center…

2. ## Personalize Your Strategy
    

![](images/personalize-it-150x150.jpg)Once you establish a target, it’s all about determininig what steps you’ll need to take in order to hit it.

What exactly do you need to do in order to reach the goal?

You need to “tailor” (custom fit) a plan for your unique situation. While your goal may be the same as other people, the steps they take may not work for you. You need steps that YOU can complete, steps that will take YOU and YOUR specific place in life to where YOU want to go.

It’s not a cookie cutter, “one size fits all” plan. Identify the necessary steps. Try to keep the steps to single digits. In other words, no more than nine steps. Preferably as little as 3-5. Sure, there will be sub-steps within the larger blocks, but the few major steps the better. It will seem less daunting.

3. ## Train & Learn to Become a Pro
    

![oNLINE JOBS IN kenya](images/KEEP-LEARNING-150x150.jpg)Once you have identified the steps, you need to go into training. That is, you must “become proficient” at those steps you’ve listed that will take you to your target.

You need to learn how to complete the necessary steps. Learn them by reading. Learn them by observing. Learn them by trying. Don’t get sidetracked with a lot of extra details.Be focused. Precise.

If you need to learn how to build an email marketing list, don’t get distracted by that shiny new course on blog design.

4. ## Toil
    

![Online jobs in Kenya](images/keep-working-150x150.jpg)This is the hard part. It’s easy to set a goal. It’s not difficult to identity a set of steps. It’s even not that hard to read, observe and try.

What is hard is WORK. This is where most people stop. Whether they get frustrated or confused or lazy or indifferent or whatever it is, they don’t put in the time and effort to get the job done.

I’ve seen many would-be bloggers drop out right here because the work requires too much time and effort and discomfort. Likewise, I’ve seen many internet marketers abandon their dream of a successful business because it requires “toil” – it requires determination, persistence and effort.

Don’t stop short of your target. Work hard!

5. ## Tweak and Improve
    

![](images/dream-it-150x150.jpg)Rarely do you get to the finish line without some form of failure. Things go wrong. The best laid plans fall through. It doesn’t turn out exactly as you envisioned. Don’t let that set you back. Instead, learn from it. Fix it. Improve it. Move on.

There WILL be times when you fail. All of us do. It’s a fact of life. It’s not a matter of failing, it’s a matter of how you respond. You get knocked down. Will you stay down? Or will you get back up and keep moving?

Tweak that plan. And get to the target!

6. ## Thrive
    

![](images/enjoy-the-moment-150x150.jpg)If you do the things I’ve mentioned so far, you WILL “thrive”. You will excel. You will taste the finish line, feel the rush of victory. Success will be yours.

Whether it’s looking in the mirror and seeing a thin version of yourself or crossing the finish line of a marathon or working from home at your successful internet business, the fact remains the same: you did it!

Enjoy the moment. Don’t get complacent, but enjoy the moment. Reap the rewards of your effort. And start setting the next goal.

But before you get to that…

7. ## Teach Others How to do It
    

![work online kenya](images/teach-150x150.jpg)What is genuine success if you can’t pass it on to others? Seriously, what person who loses 75 pounds wouldn’t want to share his story with others who are struggling so they too can experience success?

I teach to make a living. There’s no mistake about that. But I also teach because I’ve seen success and I truly want to help others achieve similar (and greater) levels of success.

When you hit your target, don’t forget that there are others who are back at step one.They need some guidance. They need some help. They need you.

That’s my “Success system”. Been using it since as long as I can remember. Business, non-business. Doesn’t matter what I want to do – this system works.

Use it to get where you want to go.

And if you need some help, I’ll be glad to be your “go to” guy for guidance. We can work together to setup a plan for you that applies these steps to YOUR specific business.
