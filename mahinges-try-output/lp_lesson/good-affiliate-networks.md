Affiliate networks were covered in decent detail in Lesson 1 of this guide guide, but it’s important to get a little more in-depth.

As mentioned in the first lesson, Affiliate Networks basically bring together a bunch of companies that want you, the affiliate, to promote their products.

They take a small cut of the profits, and in turn, give you your paycheck, and save you the time and effort it would take to establish a direct relationship with these companies.

Instead of needing to search far and wide for something good to promote, and then signing up for their affiliate program, and then hoping it works, you can just pick from a big ass list, and in some cases, see if it’s doing well for other affiliates too.

Very convenient.

## Things You Should Know Before Signing Up for Affiliate Networks

There are some things you should know before signing up to affiliate networks.

First, most of them have what seems like a strict approval process.  In reality it’s not that strict.  There are a lot of idiots from shady countries who sign up to these networks, send fraudulent leads, get a paycheck, and run before shit hits the fan.

Networks try to avoid this, obviously, because they’re responsible for these losses, not the merchant, usually.  So if you’re not from the US, the UK, or Canada, you may have a difficult time getting approved.  Sucks to be us. I have a list of affiliate networks that accepts affiliates from practically anywhere [here](https://mahinge.com/best-cpa-affiliate-networks-for-beginners/).

As soon as you apply, contact/call them and let them know you put your application in.

If you get rejected, call them and ask them why. A good majority of the time, just talking to them on the phone is enough to get you approved, so make those calls, unless you put “John Anderson” as your name on the application but actually sound like Ahmed Bashir or Kiraitu Murungi on the phone.

The most frequently asked question about the whole signup process is usually about the application form. People seem to not know what to do when asked by the affiliate network what their website is. Just put any website you own.

If you don’t have anything legit, put the URL of your most active social media account (LinkedIn should work) or the domain name of your tracking software if you went with the self-hosted option.  If you don’t even have that, just put something like www.idonthaveone.com and explain in the comments that you’re new or just do direct-to-offer campaigns... Though in all honesty, you need to have a personal website even if it's just for the sake of having customized email address such as hello@YourName.com

## What to Do Once You're Approved

Once you get approved to an affiliate network, make sure you reach out to your AM (affiliate manager) to introduce yourself.

Ask what is converting well, and for any advice they may have for a beginner like yourself.

Affiliate Managers range in effectiveness from very good all the way down to fcking retarded. They are essentially sales/customer service people for the network, and they get a percentage of the revenue they convince you to generate with their company.

Make sure you understand that it is their ultimate goal to help you and the rest of their affiliates make more money.

Develop a good relationship with your AM, be loyal to the ones who treat you well, and they will return the favor and hook you up when you need it.

On the other hand, until you know you can trust them, don’t give them any more information about your campaigns than you have to.  There are plenty of shady affiliate managers who are more than willing to share your campaign data with other affiliates just to make themselves a quick buck.

Remember that in the Affiliate to Affiliate Network relationship, you are the boss.  They want your business, they rely on you, not the other way around.

There are hundreds of networks, and if one of them screws you, switch.

If you want a higher payout on an offer, ask for it.  Getting a higher payout on an offer is not a privilege.  It is not something that should be conditional on the volume you are producing. Don’t fall victim to companies who jerk you around and treat you like a newbie (even though you are).

On the flipside, never screw over the affiliate networks.  They are the ones giving you your paychecks.  Never try to send them fraudulent leads.  Never send incentivized traffic to offers that do not allow it.  Never bid on keyword terms when they disallow it.

Basically don’t screw them. You will get banned, they will keep your commissions, and they will talk about you to other networks.  It’s a very small world, and the last thing you want to do is burn bridges.

## **AFFILIATE LINK** WHOING **TIME**

That’s right folks, here is one of those not so rare occasions where I link to a bunch of affiliate networks with my referral link.

Basically, if you use the links below, the affiliate networks you will be signing up for will know that Patrick Mahinge referred you.

This means a few things.

First, and most important, I will get a small referral fee from the network (generally about 2-5% of whatever you generate) as a thank-you from the network.  If you don’t sign up with my referral link and then plan to at some point in the future ask the me a question (which I answer quite frequently) I’ll probably tell you to go eat a fat duck and to ask some worthless waste of life like Tyler for the answer and see how much help you get.

Also if you get rejected by the network when applying, but you signed up with my referral url, I can generally help you get approved. Also, what kind of self respecting affiliate would I be if I didn’t use my affiliate link everywhere, rite?

## Best CPA Affiliate Networks

Ok.  So here is a list of Affiliate Networks that I know personally, and trust.  None of these have ever failed to pay me on time, or ever done anything to screw me over.

Just because a network isn’t on this list doesn’t necessarily mean they suck, maybe I've never worked with them, etc.  There is a little background on each as well as some of the names of some good peeps at the company that you may want as your AM if you can request it:

1. [Traffic Company](https://mahinge.com/loves/traffic-company/):
2. [MyLead](https://mahinge.com/loves/mylead/)
3. Mobipium

Do your best to get approved at these 6 networks and you will thank yourself later.
