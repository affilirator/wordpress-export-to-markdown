For any type of paid online advertising campaign, accurate tracking is probably the most important part of being successful.

Tracking is what separates the amateur from the pro. Without it, you will have a difficult time knowing exactly what is going on with your campaigns, which is not only frustrating, but can lose you a lot of money.

I use and recommend [FunnelFlux Pro](https://funnelflux.com/pro/?fp_ref=j851r), which is a very comprehensive affiliate tracking platform.  It has pretty much every bell and whistle you could think of outside of managing your bids for you.

FunnelFlux is the easiest tracking softwater for beginners.

Anyway, as this post is part of a beginners guide, you may be completely lost at this point, and have no idea what tracking will actually do for you, or how to use it once you have it set up.

Don’t worry.

You don’t really need to know what it does at this point, you just need to set it up in preparation for things down the road.  If you do it properly now, things will be much easier for you later on, and that’s all you really need to know right now.

FunnelFlux has two different versions. They have the hosted version, and the self-hosted version.

If you’re a complete newbie and don’t know anything about computers and servers, please use the hosted version ([FunnelFlux Pro](https://funnelflux.com/pro/?fp_ref=j851r)) as that requires no real work on your part to set up.  All you have to do is sign up for an account.

The drawback is, it’s hosted on their servers, so you are relying on their hosting to never go down. Their servers are rather stable, though.  Another possible drawback is, since it’s on their servers, they have access to your data.  This has been discussed over and over, and paranoid people may be worried about this. But knowing knowing the guys behind FunnelFlux Pro, I would seriously doubt they would be interested in stealing your campaign info.

The self hosted version of [FunnelFlux](https://funnelflux.com/self-hosted/?fpr=t6e1u) requires that you buy a domain, hosting, and set up the software on your hosting.

It’s not too difficult if you know how to do at least a few of the following: Read, tie your shoes, color inside the lines, not eat the crayons afterwards, fit the square peg in the square hole, etc.  Skip the following setup parts if you’ve decided to go with the hosted version.

So, first you need a domain name and some hosting.

Go buy yourself any random domain at [namecheap.com](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7020401-15083066).  Nobody will ever see this domain as you will only be using it for tracking, so just buy whatever random .com domain name comes to mind.

Namecheap gives out a free year of whoisguard for each domain, which prevents most people from seeing who owns the domain, which is good for keeping your campaign info secret-ish.

After that, you will need hosting.

I do not keep tabs on hosting providers much.  I has a dedicated server at [Contabo](https://mahinge.com/loves/contabo/) that I use for my tracking server, but it was a complete b!tch to set up, so you may want to go with a more managed solution for yourself unless you want to go through a big headache.

After you've setup hosting, you just point your new domain at your new hosting (if you don’t know how to do this, you should check your hosting documentation), and then you’re ready to set up the self-hosted FunnelFlux tracking software.

For setting up FunnelFlux on your hosting, just read the documentation provided. It really should only take a few minutes.  Just upload the files, and just go to your tracking url and click install pretty much.

If you've problems setting up the tracker, you can book a one hour of one-on-one and I'll glady take you through it.
