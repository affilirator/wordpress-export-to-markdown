## ECONOMICS- IS BUYING A DFY NICHE SITE CHEAPER?

There's a general assumption that building your own niche site would be cheaper. There's no doubt that you can skimp on all the premium tools and choose to write your own content. But still...

Realistically, in order to start a profitable niche site, you'll need to put in some investment. You will need premium keyword research tools; you will want to invest in a premium WordPress theme. You'll need to invest time or money on training. You will want a designer to design your site. And you'll need to hire a VA to assist you when you screw up things with your site.

These little costs add up. Typical costs for a niche site would look like what you're seeing on the right. That's a total of $1,258. And you haven't even factored in training!
