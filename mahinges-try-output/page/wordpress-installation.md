The best way that I know of to get your own website up and going in a few hours time is through a WordPress Blog.

The problem most people have with getting their own website up and running is that they don’t know how to set it up.

![wordpress logo Free Wordpress Blog Installations](images/wordpress_logo.png "wordpress_logo")WordPress blog installations are fairly easy but I have found that there are always a  few small hang-ups that most people encounter when attempting to install their blog.

### **Here’s a few of the problems you may encounter when setting up a WordPress blog website:**

- You don’t know how to set up their domain name
- You don’t know the best website hosting service to use
- You don’t know how to set up an “add-on domain” on your server.
- You don’t know how to install the blog
- You don’t know “in which directory” to install the WordPress blog
- You don’t know how to customize the set-up for maximum SEO benefits
- You don’t have the time to set up your website
- You don’t want to spend a lot of money on a professional website

**There’s a simple solution.**

For a limited time I will install your WordPress blog for you for FREE.

That’s right!  I won’t charge you anything for my services.

Not only that, I’ll also install a theme and install some of the plug-ins  that I am using on this website as well:

### **Here’s what I am willing to do for you:**

- Install your blog.
- Install the WordPress theme of your choice
- Install some essential plug-ins including  Sitemap, Link Checker, All in One SEO Pack and Contact Form 7.
- Customize your general settings, user and log-in information, and your website url
- Configure your website for better SEO by customizing your permalinks (You won’t have weird numbers showing up on your blog post URL’s.)
- Setup comment moderation to protect you from blog comment spam.

### **Why I’ll install Your Blog For Free**

You may be wondering what the catch is. Why would I install your WordPress blog for free?

It’s simple. The hosting service that I recommend pays  me a commission for referring you to their service. In other words, they pay me instead of you paying me.

I’ve chosen [BlueHost](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.bluehost.com/track/gnemer1/text1) which is the very best web hosting service for blog installations. All you have to do is signup for a new hosting account through my recommended hosting provider using  [my link](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.bluehost.com/track/gnemer1/text1) which will give me credit for referring you to the hosting provider’s website.

I recommend BlueHost for the best prices available and also since they are the easiest to use.

**Please allow me to clarify**: I provide installation of a WordPress blog only IF you purchase BlueHost through me..  If you already have a host I can’t install  your blog fro free. _I currently charge $100 to install a blog on another host because they’re setup differently and it may take longer._

I require that  you sign up for a minimum one-year term to be eligible for my free website installation service… although you’ll get  free [domain names](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/domains) and even cheaper prices if you order a full two-year term .

**More information about [BlueHost](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.bluehost.com/track/gnemer1/ "My choice for easiest web hosting") [](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.bluehost.com/track/gnemer1/ "My choice for easiest web hosting").** The cost for this service is as follows:

2 years- $6.95 monthly or $166  total (domain name included)

1 year- $7.95 monthly or $95  total (domain name costs extra)

### **Why BlueHost?**

I recommend BlueHost because I have found their customer service to be very good. They also include the following:

- Free Domain Name
- Free Privacy
- Top Notch 24/7 Support
- $25 Free Yahoo Credits
- $50 Free Google Credits
- and a whole lot more…

You must use [the link for Bluehost](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.bluehost.com/track/gnemer1/) provided on this page to be eligible for my free blog installation service.

### Premium Themes

I’ll also install the theme of your choice on your website. Choosing a theme can be fun. There are a lot of free WordPress themes out there. I’ve listed some of my favorites here.

- [Copyblogger](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.copyblogger.com/the-copyblogger-theme-for-wordpress/ "The Copyblogger Theme")
- [Cutline](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://cutline.tubetorial.com/ "Cutline Theme")
- [OpenAir](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/wordpressextend/themes/openair)

You’ll get any WordPress theme that you like on your blog. The free ones are nice, however a Premium WordPress Theme can offer flexibility and a professional image for your website (You get what you pay for.).

**There are 3 Premium WordPress Theme Providers that I recommend** (affiliate links included):

- [Thesis by DIY Themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://reallifepurpose.com/thesis "The Thesis Theme")\- I am using the [Thesis theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/thesis) on this website because it has all the bells and whistles and has excellent Search engine optimization capabilities.
- The Flex Theme by [IThemes-](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=103143u0026amp;c=ibu0026amp;aff=16997u0026amp;ev=093352de05 "IThemes Themes")The Flex theme is easy to Customize and VERY Flexible. Ithemes provides me with a [25 discount code](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/ithemes-2008-theme-club-delivers-great-service). I also provide a premium theme buyers guide in pdf format from ithemes which you can [download for free by clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/ebooks/premium_theme_guide-1rlp.pdf "Instant download").
- [StudioPress Themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.reallifepurpose.com/studiopress)\-These theme’s, formerly called Revolution, are a little bit more difficult to customize but provide a nice looking website. I’m using StudioPress on my website at [Missions With Purpose](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.missionswithpurpose.com/) and on my [Fat Loss website](https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140307/http://www.fitonpurpose.com/blog/ "Lose Weight")

_When you use the links provided I’ll make a commission from these themes so I’ll install them for you at no cost since some of them require a little bit more knowledge for installation. However, since these themes are a little bit extensive to set-up I cannot customize them for you for free._
