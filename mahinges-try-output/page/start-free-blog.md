Hey there,

My name is Patrick Kihara and **I want to help you succeed online**. That is why I have started the **Blogscheme Mentorship Program**. Through the Mentorship Program, I seek to help people like you make the best out of their time on the internet.

My mentorship programme will accord you with 3 crucial things:

1. I will help you start a blog/website for free
2. I will teach you all the little technical details about blogging
3. I will help you grow and monetize your blog

I will help you through all the three for free!

The thing is, I make all my money online- enough to pay the bills and set aside a hefty sum for a rainy day. However, instead of continuing to make more money online simply for the sake of it, I have given myself a new goal and a purpose for 2015.[![work online in kenya](images/patoh-300x168.jpg)](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/patoh.jpg)

> I want to help as many people as I possibly can start making money online. In a nutshell, if you want to make money blogging but don't know how to do it, I want to help you through the whole process. However, I do not stop there. **I will do it for you absolutely free**!

## You Need a Blog to Make it Online

Why a blog? Why not give me an online job that I can do to make money?

Because...

I believe in creating the future. I believe in empowering you to take control of your own income, and I won't lie to you. If you want to work online and never look back to the dreaded pursuit of employment, you need a blog. My comfortable online lifestyle began the moment I started my first blog. One year down the road, my monthly online income had skyrocketed to close to 80,000/=! I was able to quit my job and live entirely on the income that I make online.

In this mentorship programme, I will show you the exact strategies that I use to make money online without working for anyone, online or offline!

## So, What's the Catch

I am glad you asked.

I have entered into agreement with one of the best web hosting providers in the world in order to bring you this awesome service. Whenever you sign up for an [iPage web hosting account](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage "iPage") using any of the links on this blog, I get paid a commission. The commission essentially acts as my 'fee' for setting up your blog and helping you grow and monetize it.

In a nutshell, you pay for your own web hosting and you get a knowledgeable mentor to help you navigate through the treacherous world of making money online. Simply fill the form below and I will email you the instructions.
